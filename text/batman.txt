EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

Gotham City. The City of Tomorrow: stark angles,
creeping shadows, dense, crowded, as if hell had erupted
through the sidewalks. A dangling fat moon shines
overhead.

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

PUSHERS wave to HOOKERS. STREET HUSTLERS slap high-fives
with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
each other... with one conspicuous exception:

A TOURIST FAMILY, MOM, DAD, AND LITTLE JIMMY, march
warily down the main drag. Just out of a show. But the
respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and now --
Playbills in hand -- they're on Gotham's meanest street.

MOM
For God's sake, Harold, can we
please just get a taxi??

DAD
I'm trying to get a --
(shouting)
TAXI!!

Three cabs streak pass and disappear. Jimmy reads map.

JIMMY
We're going the wrong way.

Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker.

DAD
Put that AWAY. We'll look like
tourists.

TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night
souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a
HOOKER.

The HOOKER smiles at Jimmy. Jimmy smiles back. Mom
yanks him off down the street and glowers at Dad.

DAD
We'll never get a cab. Let's cut
over to Seventh.

JIMMY
Seventh is that way.

DAD
I know where we are!

EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Deserted street lined with stripped-down cars. Family
marches into the darkness.

VOICE
Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?

A DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, acne-scarred -- his
ratty T-shirt -- "I LOVE GOTHAM CITY" -- family moves on,
pretending not to hear.

DERELICT
Mister. How about it. One dollar?
(standing up)
Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
English??

TOURISTS cross street. DERELICT doesn't follow.

Their pace quickens. A SHADOWY FIGURE in the alleyway.
A GLOVED HAND slams a GUN across Dad's neck.

He crumples. Mom grabs Jimmy and backs up against a
brick wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races
across the street to join his confederate, the STREET
PUNK, who's already searching for Dad's wallet.

Mom's ready to snap -- STREET PUNK trains his gun on
Jimmy.

STREET PUNK
Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
scream.

TEARS stream down her face. She stifles a scream and
clutches Jimmy. He's paralyzed with fear.

The two PUNKS CHUCKLE and race away.

Mom's self-control disintegrates -- she begins to SCREAM
before moving to unconscious Dad. SCREAM ECHOES.

EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

A darkly ornate Gothic anomaly: old City Cathedral, once
grand, long since boarded up.

STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from their shadowy rooftops.

Mom's SCREAM (uninterrupted from the previous scene)
ECHOES up. And one of the GARGOYLES MOVES.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Six stories up.

The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down on the tar-
and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.

NICK
All RIGHT. American Express.
(tossing the credit
card at Eddie)
Don't leave home without it.

A chill wind BLOWS as Nick counts cash. There's a
distant, metallic CLANG; EDDIE hears it and tenses up.

EDDIE
Let's beat it, man. I don't like
it up here.

NICK
What are ya, scared of heights?

EDDIE
I dunno. After what happened to
Johnny Gobs --

NICK
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
walked off a roof, all right? No
big loss.

EDDIE
No, man. That ain't what I heard
at all.
(beat)
I heard the BAT got him.

NICK
The BAT?! Gimme a break, will
you, Eddie?

EDDIE
Five stories, straight down.
There was no blood in the body.

NICK
No shit. It was all over the
pavement.

ANOTHER SOUND. Now even Nick can't ignore the slight
tingle at the base of his spine...

NICK
Shut up.
(conclusively)
There ain't no bat.

At the opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards
away... at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE
is dropping slowly, implacably, into frame...

EDDIE
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --

NICK
You want your cut of this money or
don't you? Now shut up! Shut
up --

BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of
BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their
JAWS DROP.

At the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a BLACK
APPARITION.

Eddie freezes, a choked GURGLE in his throat. The BLACK
FIGURE advances and spreads its arms, slowly, majes-
tically. GREAT SHADOWY WINGS flap in the wind.

On its chest is THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval yellow
field, glowing like a target in the darkness..

Nick drops to the gravel, grabs the GUN, and FIRES TWICE.
TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure is knocked
bodily to the roof.

NICK
-- I'm gettin' outta here.

He bends to retrieve his loot. Eddie lets out AN ODD,
PRE-VERBAL SQUEAL...

... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET, NIGHT-
MARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.

Panic. Stolen money flutters out of Nick's hands. He
SCUTTLES FRANTICALLY across the roof. The BLACK SPECTRE
is blocking his path to the fire escape. Trapped like a
rat, Nick FIRES WILDLY.

Eddie's face is pale. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG
snakes out. A BLACK BOOT catches Eddie high on the chest
-- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING
THROUGH THE AIR. Eddie slams into a brick chimney and
slumps unconscious.

THE BAT DOESN'T EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. Nick CHARGES past
the black wraith, toward the fire escape...

A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and Nick pitches
forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. SCREAM-
ING, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the BAT at
his heels... 'til there's no place left to go. Nick
cowers on the edge.

Nick keeps SHOOTING. Eyes closed. Hammer falls on an
empty chamber, but Nick still pulls the trigger. He
MOANS.

BAT grabs Nick by the shirt, HOISTS HIM into the air.

NICK
Don't kill me... don't kill me...

Nick opens his eyes... the BAT is standing on the ledge
of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at arm's length, over six
stories of nothingness. A rasping VOICE.

BATMAN
You're trespassing, Ratbreath.

Nick looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.

He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where
Batman's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own
stricken face.

NICK
Trespassing? You don't own the
night.

BATMAN
Tell your friends. Tell all your
friends. I AM the night.

Nick HOWLS. Batman heaves him roughly back onto the tar-
and-gravel surface of the roof. And then -- casually,
without a moment's hesitation -- steps off the ledge,
into midair.

Trembling, Nick crawls to the ledge and looks over...
finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.

Nick is still SCREAMING as we PAN UP TO Gotham's moon.

CUT TO:

INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT

A VICTORY POSTER fills one wall: "CONGRATULATIONS! A
NEW GOTHAM CITY! HARVEY DENT - DISTRICT ATTORNEY."

MAYOR BORG, hysterical and self-certain introduces the
new District Attorney, HARVEY DENT -- a young, determined
lawyer.

MAYOR BORG
Across this nation, the words
'Gotham City' are synonymous with
crime. Our streets are overrun,
and our police officials have been
helpless. As Mayor I promised you
that I would root out the source
of corruption at the root! Boss
Carl Grissom! Our new District
Attorney Harvey Dent will carry
out that promise. I promise.

APPLAUSE. DENT stands to speak. We SEE a SINGLE EMPTY
PLACE SETTING at the end of the table -- and an engraved
placecard which bears the name "BRUCE WAYNE."

DENT
I'm a man of few words. But those
words will count. And so will our
actions. I have talked today to
Police Commissioner Gordon.

ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON

Gotham's police commissioner, a distinguished gent in
his late fifties.

DENT
He is targeting businesses
suspected of fronting for the
syndicate in this city. Within
one week we'll knock down their
doors and shed the light of the
law on that nest of vipers.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

A woman's apartment, sparsely furnished but tasteless.
Modern chairs and coffee table in front of a TV set.
High-fashion magazine picture blow-ups all modeled by
the same girl on walls.

In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, and
manicured, manipulates a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-
handed shuffle with extraordinary finesse.

The TV news has highlights of HARVEY DENT's victory
speech.

DENT (V.O.)
(on the TV screen)
Together we can make this city
safe for decent people --

THE HAND sets the deck on a table, turns up FOUR JACKS
off the top. This most unusual deck sports a .22 calibre
BULLET HOLE straight through the middle.

JACK NAPIER
Decent people shouldn't live here.
They'd be happier someplace else.

JACK NAPIER is right-hand man and chief enforcer to
BOSS CARL GRISSOM.

He is tough, vain, takes great pride in his appearance,
and is not reconciled to no longer being twenty one.
Velvet Death. ALICIA HUNT -- CARL GRISSOM's woman --
glides over in her negligee. Jack has his feet on the
table, resting on a copy of Vogue on the cover of which
is a picture of Alicia. She lifts his feet and rescues
the magazine. She is young, very beautiful, and as
narcissistic as Jack. She's the model pictured on the
walls.

ALICIA
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

JACK
Don't worry about it. It this
clown could tough Grissom... I'd
have killed him by now.

Alicia knots Jack's loose tie playfully about his neck.

ALICIA
If Grissom knew about us... he
might kill you.

Jack's eye darts back and forth between the TV and his
own reflection in a nearby vanity. Not interested in
her.

JACK
Don't flatter yourself, angel.
He's a tired old man. He can't
run this city without me.
(pause)
And besides, he doesn't know.

Jack remotes OFF the TV.

ALICIA
You don't worry about anything,
do you, Jack?

Jack gives Alicia a disdainful look, consults his watch,
reaches for his topcoat, and stands in front of the
vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted hair, checks his
fine threads.

ALICIA
You look fine.

He smiles at himself before turning to the door.

JACK
... I didn't ask.

CUT TO:

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

The scene of the earlier mugging is now ABUZZ with police
cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.

Eddie goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. Watching him
are a POLICE MEDIC and a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, who
jots on a notepad.

ECKHARDT
No, let me guess. A gigantic,
menacing, supernatural form... in
the shape of a bat.

MEDIC
That's it... What are they SEEING
up there?

ECKHARDT
They're all drinkin' Drano.

MEDIC
It's still weird, Lieutenant.

ECKHARDT
(under his breath)
Oh Christ, Knox!

At the mouth of the alley is ALEXANDER KNOX, 30, a crime
reporter for the Gotham Globe.

KNOX
Hiya, gents. I hear we got
another bat attack.
That's eight 'sightings' now in
just under a month. I hear the
Commissioner's opened a file.

ECKHARDT
Sorry, Knox. These two slipped
on a banana peel.

Two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-fried Nick past.

NICK
A bat, I tell you, a GIANT bat!
He wanted me to do him a favor...!

Knox smirks. Eckhardt and the Medic trade disgusted
looks.

ECKHARDT
(irritated)
Don't be writing this crap in the
newspaper, Knox, it'll ruin your
already useless reputation.

KNOX
Lieutenant. Lotsa punks in town're
scared stiff! They say he drinks
blood. They say he can't be killed.

ECKHARDT
I say you're full of shit, Knox.

Eckhardt turns away in annoyance.

ECKHARDT
And you can quote me on that!

KNOX
Lieutenant. Is there a six-foot
bat in Gotham City?
(shouting)
If so, is he on the police payroll?
If so, what's he pulling down
after taxes?

EXT. STREET - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Eckhardt emerges onto the side street -- and spies a
STRETCH LIMO IDLING nearby. Leaning on the hood, waving
hi, is the dandyish Jack NAPIER. Jack's odd driver BOB
HAWKINS polishes the door handle.

Jack swaggers up and tosses Eckhardt a sandwich bag.

JACK
I brought you a little snack,
Eckhardt.

Eckhardt looks at the sandwich inside. It's full of 100
DOLLAR BILLS. The cop throws a nervous glance back in
KNOX's direction and stuffs it quickly in his coat.

ECKHARDT
Why don't you broadcast it, Napier?

JACK
Shut up and listen -- Harvey Dent
is sniffing around one of our
companies.

Eckhardt bristles.

ECKHARDT
(testy)
That's my territory, Jack. If
there's a problem --

Suddenly, Jack grabs Eckhardt by the lapels of his
topcoat.

JACK
Eckhardt... your problems are our
problems.

ECKHARDT
(knocking his hands
away)
I answer to Grissom, not to
Psychos.

JACK
Why, Eckhardt. You should be
thinking about the future.

ECKHARDT
(sneers)
You mean... when you run the show?
You got no future, Jack. You're
an A-1 nut boy and Grissom knows
it.

Jack claps a hand on Eckhardt's face and shoves him full-
force into a wall. Stunned, Eckhardt turns bright red
and grabs Jack by the coat collar and whips out his gun.

Jack calmly takes his hand from Eckhardt's face as the
latter brings the gun up.

JACK
(relaxed)
Watch the suit.

Breathing heavily, Eckhardt lets go of Jack's coat and
lowers the gun.

JACK
(smiles)
See. You can make a good decision
when you try.

Jack LAUGHS insanely in Eckhardt's ashen face, EXITS.
When Jack is out of earshot, Eckhardt MUTTERS
menacingly:

ECKHARDT
And where you been spending your
nights, handsome...?

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GOTHAM CITY SQUARE - DAY

Hard-hatted Dent and Gordon follow Mayor across the
construction-filled square. Preparations are being made
for a gigantic public event. Banner goes up saying
"200TH ANNIVERSARY OF GOTHAM CITY FESTIVAL."

MAYOR
I don't care how much in debt this
festival is. I want a parade, hot
dogs, balloons, the whole schmeer.
We're gonna celebrate this 200th
anniversary proudly. And PUBLICLY.

DENT
We may be celebrating it in
bankruptcy court. The tax base
is crumbling, and if this festival
crashes you can kiss our bond
rating goodbye. The Festival is
$350,000 in the red and we haven't
seen one balloon.

MAYOR
I'll take care of the festival
budget. I've got a party of rich
old ladies who'll pay $1000 to see
the inside of Wayne Manor. You
fill this square with people, kids,
dogs, families, and the businesses
will come back here.

GORDON
I think a lot of people might stay
away, Mayor. They're scared.

MAYOR
They won't be scared when you've
got Grissom in that courthouse. I
promised that, right?

Gordon nods as Mayor marches across the square.

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

Gotham's leading tabloid daily. KNOX RUSHES IN, spots
BOB THE CARTOONIST at his drafting table, with several
amused REPORTERS looking on.

REPORTER
Well, well. Count Dracula! You
seen Bigfoot lately?

ANOTHER REPORTER
They BURIED your story on the
Batman.

REPORTER
They bury garbage.

KNOX
This is the Pulitzer prize zone,
boys! You wait!

BOB
Oh, Knox -- I got something for
you.

BOB holds up a drawing of a HUMAN BAT, with an awful,
fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The cap-
tion reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"

The REPORTERS CRACK up. Knox, who's used to the ribbing,
mumbles.

KNOX
Very nice, boys. A little more
gore on the fangs.
(under his breath)
What a dick...

He moves on

INT. KNOX'S OFFICE - DAY

Knox approaches but stops in his tracks.

Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF EXCEPTIONAL LEGS.
Knox stares. He takes her in -- the most beautiful woman
he's ever seen is attached to the legs. Leaning back in
Knox's swivel chair, reading the Globe. Her face
obscured by a big outrageous HAT. He ENTERS.

KNOX
Hel-lo, legs.

The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a
shock of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile.

VICKI
I'm reading your stuff.

KNOX
And I'm reading yours.

He looks at the oversized CAMERA BAG with decals all over
it. Monogrammed "V.V." She stands, shakes hands.

VICKI
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

Her attitude is strong, hip, professional.

KNOX
Vicki Vale... Vicki Vale... Let's
see... Vogue, Cosmo... I've seen
your stuff. Listen, you didn't
come here to ask me to pose nude,
because you're going to need a
long lens.

VICKI
Actually I've been in Corto
Maltese.

She pulls out a sheet of COMBAT PHOTOS -- exploding Jeeps,
burning huts, bodies in piles. A bloody revolution.

KNOX
Hey , a girl could get hurt doing
this.

Knox is impressed but he's also smitten:

KNOX
(amazed)
What are you doing here?

VICKI
I'm here to see some of the
wildlife in Gotham City.

KNOX
Wildlife... like what?

VICKI
Like -- bats.

She indicates his desk which is littered with doodles of
bats.

KNOX
(disbelieving)
Who sent you?

VICKI
No one. I read your piece.
There's something about this
that's very interesting to me.

KNOX
What's your angle?

VICKI
A picture of a guy in a bat suit
catching criminals?
(her hand sweeping
a headline)
BATMAN SWEEPS CRIME FROM GOTHAM.
My pictures. Your words. This
is Pulitzer prize material.

KNOX
(exhilarated)
You're a visionary. Problem is,
you're the only one who believes
me. I need something tangible.
Gordon's got a file on this but I
can't get him on the phone.

A sly look crosses Vicki's face.

VICKI
He'll be at Bruce Wayne's benefit,
won't he?

KNOX
I don't seem to be on the guest
list.

Sulking, he doesn't notice Vicki reaching into her camera
bag. He doesn't see the small white INVITATION until she
DANGLES IT right in front of his nose.

KNOX
Miss Vale... Got a date?

She flutters her great big eyelashes and shakes her head
no.

VICKI
Will you help me?

KNOX
Yes. Will you marry me?

VICKI
Perhaps. Do you snore?

She LAUGHS. He offers her his arm.

KNOX
I'll learn.

CUT TO:

INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW on the best view in Gotham.  
CARL GRISSOM, criminal kingpin, is 50, utterly without
charm.

His LIEUTENANTS -- bloodless white-collar types as well
as a few outright GOONS -- are sprawled nearby in easy
chairs. Grissom waves a copy of the Globe -- with HARVEY
DENT staring out from page one.

GRISSOM
Say this son of a bitch makes a
connection with us and Axis
Chemicals, what kind of damage are
we looking at?

ACCOUNTANT
If he ties us in with Axis Chemical,
we're dead and buried.
(clearing his throat)
We should move immediately.

Jack slouches in an easy chair doing his one-handed
shuffle.

JACK
Let's just break-in, trash the
office, make off with the books...
and call it 'industrial espionage.'

GRISSOM
Smart thinking, Jack.
That's the way to go. In fact --
I'd like you to handle this
operation personally.

Jack's hand FREEZES over his lucky deck. Nervously, he
turns a card off the top. It's not a jack; it's a Joker
-- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre HOLE through
its face.

At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and
ALICIA HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private elevator with
an armful of SHOPPING BAGS.

GRISSOM
Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if
you'd mind waiting in the other
room.

Alicia's gaze meets Jack's nervously as she vanishes
through a side door. The eye contact is not lost on
Grissom.

GRISSOM
Thank you, gentlemen. That's all
for now.

Grissom's CRONIES FILE OUT. Jack, troubled, lingers
behind. He looks miserable and obviously doesn't want
to go.

JACK
Carl, can't we send somebody else?
The fumes in that place...

GRISSOM
Jack, it's an important job -- I
need someone I can trust. You're
my number one guy.
(beat)
Now don't forget your lucky deck.

Jack, resigned, pockets the deck and leaves.

GRISSOM
(wolfish grin)
My friend, your luck is just
about to change.

Alicia APPEARS in the doorway, modeling her new
purchases.

GRISSOM
(smiling into phone)
Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
hour's drive from Gotham. Out front, a team of
red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

The ballroom is outfitted with roulette wheels for a
CASINO NIGHT. Gotham's POWER ELITE eagerly throw cash
into Mayor's festival kitty. Small banner "SAVE THE
FESTIVAL!"

ANOTHER ANGLE - HANDSOME YOUNG BRUCE WAYNE

enters from the kitchen. He's a rich, smart guy with a
thousand things on his mind. But when you think he's not
paying attention -- you're dead wrong. He doesn't miss
a thing.

A WAITER hands him something to sign. He signs and the
waiter EXITS. Left with the pen, he isn't sure what to
do with it. He looks around and finally decides to put
it in a flowerpot. Just then ALFRED THE BUTLER, 60s
mannered but with sense of humor, APPEARS and takes it
from him. Alfred smiles as Bruce continues through the
foyer past --

In his cheap suit, stands Knox -- staring inquisitively
up at the ceiling.

Alfred appears with a tray of champagne glasses. He,
too, looks up at the ceiling.

ALFRED
Can I help you, sir?

KNOX
You know if you cut your bath in
half, you'd have my whole
apartment.

ALFRED
We do have a rather large
bathroom, sir.

KNOX
No, I meant your bath... as in
TUB.

Knox takes a drink and Alfred MOVES ON.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Alfred stoops to pick up some glasses, the other glasses
on his tray slide. He's caught a bit. Vicki catches the
glasses. Vicki smiles.

VICKI
You okay?

ALFRED
Yes, thank you.

A small bond has been formed. Alfred CONTINUES on his
way. As an afterthought Vicki calls after him. Stops.
Bruce has been watching. Vicki turns to him.

VICKI
Excuse me... which one of these
guys is Bruce Wayne?

BRUCE
(caught off guard)
I... I'm not sure.

VICKI
Thanks.

BRUCE
Uh... yeah.

Vicki WALKS AWAY. Bruce watches her, very intrigued.

ANGLE ON GORDON

At craps table, blowing into his fist, he rolls dice.
Snake eyes. He passes the dice as Knox and Vicki PUSH
UP.

KNOX
Commissioner Gordon, Mrs. Gordon.
How nice you look tonight.
(to Gordon)
Have you heard this crazy rumor
that you have opened a file on
the Batman? That's not true is
it?

Knox puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his
fingers -- like little bat ears. Gordon GROANS.

GORDON
Knox, for the ninth time, there
is no bat. If there were, we
would find him -- we would arrest
him --

KNOX
... find him, arrest him... that's
what I always hear, Commissioner.
Be straight with me.

Dent ambles up, claps a hand on Gordon's shoulder.

DENT
How's your luck, Jim?

KNOX
Mr. Dent. Commissioner Gordon and
I were just talking about winged
vigilantes, what's your stand?

DENT
Mr. Knox, we have enough real
problems in this city without
worrying about ghosts.

AN OFFICER motions to Gordon, who FOLLOWS HIM into
another room. Vicki nods at Knox as they slip away to
FOLLOW THEM.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

He watches them. Especially the beauteous Vicki.

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL CO. - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A NEON SIGN reads: "AXIS CHEMICAL. THE FUTURE IS NOW."
From the SIGN we PAN TO a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping
TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.

A PLAIN VAN pulls up. Jack and GOONS get out.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The SECURITY GUARD in a booth at the entrance to the lot.
One of Jack's BOYS creeps up and takes the GUARD out.
Jack and Goons sneak in.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ARMORY - NIGHT

Knox and Vicki ENTER looking for Gordon. No luck. Knox
goes goggle-eyed at the armory.

KNOX
(ironic)
And here we are in the arsenal.

On the wall hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Every arcane implement
of death the human mind has ever devised. Knox lets out
a low whistle.

KNOX
Look at this stuff. Who is this
guy?

Bruce ENTERS and stands just behind them. Vicki sees
him, but having seen him earlier, regards him casually,
like another partygoer. Bruce listens with interest.

VICKI
Strange. He gives to humanitarian
causes... And collects all this...

KNOX
Probably does it to get chicks.
They like him for his big charity
balls.

VICKI
(mischievous)
I think it's his enormous...
bankroll they go for.

KNOX
Hey, the more they've got, the
less they're worth.

VICKI
This guy must be the most worthless
man in America.

KNOX
(pointing to
a sword)
Where'd this come from?

BRUCE
It's Japanese.

Knox turns. Bruce is trying to remember, but is really
watching Vicki.

KNOX
How do you know?

BRUCE
Because I got it in Japan.

KNOX
Who are you?

BRUCE
Oh... Bruce Wayne.

KNOX
(extending a
hand)
Alexander Knox.

BRUCE
(genuine)
I read (present tense) your work.
I like it.

KNOX
Great. Give me a grant.

Bruce flips a polite smile at Knox then switches smoothly
to VICKI, who is amused at being had by Bruce. She
sticks out her hand.

VICKI
Vicki Vale.

BRUCE
Bruce Wayne.

VICKI
(smile and edge)
... You sure?

BRUCE
(smile)
I've seen your photographs from
Corto Maltese -- You've got an
extraordinary eye.

Bruce is charming. Knox's territorial instincts arouse.

KNOX
Some people think she has two.

VICKI
This is an amazing house. I'd
love to shoot it sometime.

A WINE STEWARD ENTERS. Vicki and Knox exchange glances.

STEWARD
Mr. Wayne, we need to open another
five cases of the champagne. Will
that be allright?

BRUCE
Uh -- yes, sure. Open six.

Steward EXITS. Bruce turns back to catch up with himself.

BRUCE
(to Vicki)
Yes... Will you be staying in
Gotham for a while?

VICKI
I'd like to. I'm intrigued by
Alex's giant bat story.

A RICH COUPLE waves at Bruce as they EXIT. He politely
waves to them. Then he looks after them like he can't
remember who they are. Then he does remember. Then back
to Vicki.

BRUCE
Isn't that a little light after a
war in Corto Maltese?

VICKI
(smiling zap)
Light? What do YOU do for a
living?

Alfred appears in the doorway behind them.

ALFRED
Sir? Commissioner Gordon was
compelled to leave.

BRUCE
Thank you, Alfred.

He turns back to Vicki. Alfred persists.

ALFRED
Ahem. Sir -- very unexpectedly.

BRUCE
(getting it)
Oh, thank you, Alfred.
(to Vicki)
I hope you'll excuse me.

Vicki smiles. A connection has been made. They both
know it.

VICKI
Sure.

Bruce turns to go. Setting his glass too close to the
edge of the table. Alfred calls to him.

ALFRED
Sir, I think perhaps THIS way.

BRUCE
Oh yes... thanks. Oh, Alfred,
they need mare wine in the front
and someone named Mrs. Daly wanted
a copy of the menu. Oh, and,
Alfred. Give Mr. Knox a grant.

He winks at Knox. And goes the OTHER way out of the
roam. Alfred fluidly sweeps up Bruce's glass and follows
him briskly OUT OF THE ROOM. Knox is stung and Vicki
transfixed.

KNOX
Nice talkin' to ya, Bruce. Now
are the rich odd? Yes they are.
(jealous)
Helllo? Vicki?

VICKI
(waking up)
Sorry, I was -- He's comp-lic-ated.

KNOX
I said odd.

VICKI
Mm.

KNOX
Ah -- Well you're not the only fan.
This guy loves himself. There're
mirrors in every roam.

And indeed, the two of them are standing before an
enormous WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from
floor to ceiling.

KNOX
Maybe it should be Bruce VAIN.

CUT TO:

REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH MIRROR

LOOKING DOWN ON Knox and Vicki THROUGH one-way glass.
Behind the mirror... recording everything that happens in
the room... is a small, silent, state-of-the-art SURVEIL-
LANCE CAMERA.

CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR

showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. The screen we're
watching is only one in a whole vast bank of video mon-
itors -- a control center showing everything that happens
in the house. The background is blurry, indistinct... but
we seem to be in the midst of a vast, dark CAVE.

On another screen, GUESTS move backward with exaggerated
speed, as a videotape REWINDS. At the panel, Bruce Wayne
hits a button -- and watches COMMISSIONER GORDON talking
to a uniformed PATROLMAN.

PATROLMAN (V.O.)
-- anonymous tip. Napier's
cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

GORDON (V.O.)
Good Lord, if we could put our
hands on him we'd have Grissom.
(obviously agitated)
Why wasn't I told about this?
Who's in charge of the --

PATROLMAN (V.O.)
Eckhardt, sir.

GORDON (V.O.)
Oh my God...

And suddenly Gordon is grabbing for his coat. The monitor
GOES BLACK. Bruce is somehow different. More relaxed.
He stands up. He gathers himself. Focuses inwardly in
a way that empowers him.

CUT TO:

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL COMPANY - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot.

Eckhardt circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing
out Xeroxed copies of a MUG SHEET: Jack NAPIER, front
and profile.

ECKHARDT
Shoot to kill.

INT. AXIS CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT

SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a
blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, Jack's HOODS
are at work on the filing cabinets. Jack stands watch-
ing, squinting through the fumes. He holds a silk
handkerchief over his nose and mouth.

The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal
door of the safe, giving Jack a good look inside:

SAFECRACKER
Empty.

JACK shakes his head: they've been set up. A SIREN
blares outside.

JACK
We've been ratted out here, boys.

INT. AXIS CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

Jack and his HOODS duck out of the office, two stories
above the refinery floor, onto a network of ladders and
CATWALKS.

A COP, stationed behind a bank of machinery, shouts out:

COP
Freeze!

One of the HOODS OPENS FIRE. Half of his colleagues dive
back into the office, looking for a rear exit. The
others take off across the CATWALKS.

INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

COPS SHOOT BACK as the HOODS scatter. The COPS' bullets
puncture ducts and pipes from which gas and unpleasant
looking liquid begins to leak.

All at once, a CORRUGATED STEEL DOOR rises -- and COM-
MISSIONER GORDON MARCHES IN with a squadron of UNIFORMED
COPS. He grabs a startled Eckhardt by the shoulder:

GORDON
What the hell is going on here?

ECKHARDT
Christ, what are you trying to do
-- blow the collar?

GORDON
I'm in charge here. Not Carl
Grissom.
(shouting)
I WANT HIM TAKEN ALIVE. I REPEAT
-- ANY MAN WHO OPENS FIRE ON JACK
NAPIER WILL ANSWER TO ME!

Eckhardt SLIPS AWAY INTO THE PLANT. Gordon realizes he's
gone and follows with gun drawn.

ANGLE ON JACK

Down on the floor, racing, THROWING SWITCHES -- anything
to create a diversion. GIGANTIC MACHINES ROAR to life.
OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place above giant
basins and spew out their contents.

COPS an Jack's tail. He SHOOTS at them AND RUNS.

ANGLE ON CATWALKS

HOODS 3 and 4 scuttle across the elevated walkways,
FIRING at the POLICE and PUNCTURING mare DUCTS, PIPES,
and CONTAINERS, thereby releasing more CHEMICALS. Their
HEADS TURN at the sound of a sudden CLANG --

-- as BATMAN drops onto the catwalk from above. For a
moment, they gape. Then HOOD 4 takes off running; HOOD
3 turns and LEVELS HIS GUN at Batman --

-- who goes to his belt for a miniature SPEAR GUN and
FIRES at HOOD 3... planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S
JACKET, SPINNING HIM AROUND. HOOD 3 drops his gun, slips,
and -- with a terrible shriek -- TOPPLES OVER THE RAILING.

The hook in his jacket jerks him up short... leaving him
to DANGLE thirty feet above the factory floor!

ANGLE ON COMMISSIONER GORDON

His gaze whips upward from the dangling hood to the
figure on the catwalk. As he's just realized... there
is a bat.

GORDON
Oh my God!!

INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - THAT MOMENT

Jack looking for an exit. Behind him, a STEEL DOOR
begins to rise -- more COPS. He picks up the axe and
runs to bottom of iron stairs to huge steel containers
with DANGER! HIGHLY TOXIC written on them under SKULL
AND CROSSBONES. He swings the axe releasing a river of
wild-colored poisons.

ANGLE ON COPS

At the bottom of the stairs, they RETREAT hastily, bump-
ing into each other, as POISONS FLOOD toward them. Jack
on other side of the chemical moat, throws away the axe
and climbs the stairs.

INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

A RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses out into the main refinery.
COPS SLIP AND SLIDE on the wet surface of the factory
floor GASPING on ACID FUMES.

METAL STAIRS LEADING TO CATWALK

Jack climbs metal stairs. Above him, vats of CHURNING
CHEMICAL SLUDGE -- and SLUICE GATES opening on the East
River. It's the waste dump.

UP ON THE CATWALK, Batman slips into the shadows and
watches Jack approach.

Jack reaches the catwalk. Located above the center of
it is a glass paneled WINDOW, propped open by a support-
ing rod. Beyond this is a forty foot drop to the swirl-
ing black currents of the East River... and freedom. To
reach the window, Jack will be exposed to police bullets.
He makes a dash for it, and has begun to climb up to it
on the catwalk railings, when BATMAN HURTLES IN and puts
him in a wrestling hold. Jack struggles for a moment,
then registers what's hit him and freaks out.

JACK
Jesus!

But just then...

VOICE
HOLD IT!

ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR - THAT MOMENT

Bob's got a gun pointed AT COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.

BOB
Let him go or I'll do Gordon.

A tense moment passes.

Eckhardt appears on floor. Looks up at Jack.

CATWALK - A MOMENT LATER

Batman releases Jack and stands clear. Jack straightens
his clothes and fixes his hair.

JACK
(smirking at Batman)
Nice outfit.

GOON
Jack, let's get out of here.

Jack spies .38 AUTOMATIC abandoned an the catwalk.

ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR

Eckhardt uses this moment to sneak away. A voice breaks
the tension:

JACK
Eckhardt!! Think about the
future!

ALL EYES TURN to Jack standing poised with the .38 in his
fist. He FIRES. Eckhardt FALLS DEAD. Jack turns gun
to Gordon.

Batman moves. Jack spins on Batman.

Their eyes meet for a second.

TIGHT ON BATMAN

-- a questioning look on his face. A spark.

TIGHT ON JACK

-- a small smile plays on his lips.

ON TRIGGER

-- He FIRES POINT BLANK at Batman.

ON BATMAN

-- he swings his heavy cape. The BULLET RICOCHETS
DIRECTLY BACK AT JACK.

AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk
above. Jack reels and staggers, CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS.
BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.

JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.

He staggers into the catwalk railing and topples over,
just managing to grab hold of the lowest rung. Directly
beneath him is a catch basin full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE.

ON CATWALK - THAT MOMENT

Batman leaps and tries to grab Jack's hand.

Jack drops but catches himself on a pipe. He's slipping.

Batman reaches, gets a poor grip. He stares, perplexed.
at the stricken expression in Jack's eyes.

CUT TO:

ON CATWALK - SAME MOMENT

Jack is sliding out of Batman's grasp. A long BEAT --
Jack looks up at him in terror and SLIPS AWAY to plunge
the TWO STORIES DOWN into the CATCH BASIN of BUBBLING,
TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING ALL THE WAY.

ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR - MOMENT LATER

GORDON
Goddammit, we had him!

COPS level their guns on Batman. A couple of them appear
at either end of the catwalk, effectively blocking his
escape. He takes in the situation, HANDS ON HIS BELT.

GORDON
Hold it right there..

Batman raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. As
the COPS advance from both ends of the catwalk -- he
flicks two tiny capsules at the nearby wall.

A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. Colors burst in a wild pyro-
technic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily
dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals Batman
from view.

A tiny grappling hook rockets out of the dense curling
cloud and catches on the edge of a window in the roof.

COP
Look!

The COPS are FIRING WILDLY into the smoke. But the BLACK
MAJESTIC FIGURE OF THE Batman whips upward, DISAPPEARING
into the shadowy heights, safely out of range.

COP
... Who is this guy?

GORDON
(to Cop)
I don't know and until we find
out, keep a lid on it.

CUT TO:

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL COMPANY - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the il-
luminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN PAST the
chemical sluice TO a SECOND ACE... a card from Jack's
lucky deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing
on the oily surface of the foul, polluted river.

Gradually, OTHER CARDS from the deck swirl past: a nine.
A deuce. A queen. And finally, a Joker -- SHOT CLEANLY
THROUGH THE FACE.

A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we --

SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

A BANNER HEADLINE on the late edition of the Globe:
"BATMAN FOILS ROBBERY. JACK NAPIER DEAD. WHO IS MASKED
VIGILANTE?"

Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a
jubilant Knox. He's on the horn to Gordon.

KNOX
Yes, Commissioner. If there's no
Bat, then who dropped this guy
Napier into the acid? Wait a
minute, I want to get this on
tape.

He holds a tape recorder up to phone. Listens. A LOUD
CLICK as Gordon hangs up on him.

Vicki BUSTLES IN with sheaf of photographs. Starts to
hang them on wail. Making a photomontage of the city.
Cartoonist sticks head in door, tapes drawing of Batman
with arm on Knox's shoulder. GUY EXITS. Knox hangs up.

KNOX
Vicki Vale! (I'm) Nostradamus!

VICKI
Look at this, Allie.

Knox comes around. She points to her montage map.

VICKI
Here's the inner city, and here's
Axis Chemicals. Here are the
sightings so far.

KNOX
Did you do this? This is great.

VICKI
Maybe the Batman's got some sort
of flight pattern or something.

KNOX
Yeah, tonight we'll walk the
trail.

VICKI
Tomorrow maybe. I've got a date
with Bruce Wayne. Sorry.

KNOX
(shouting)
Bruce Wayne? No, A DATE is when
two normal people go out to enjoy
each other. A date for Bruce
WAYNE is when he goes out to a
restaurant with mirrors, by
HIMSELF!

She plants a kiss on his forehead.

VICKI
You're awfully sweet to be so
concerned but thanks anyway.

Vicki smiles and EXITS. Knox looks pole-axed.

KNOX
(irritated, picking
up phone)
Copy, get me the morgue.
(BEAT)
Morgue... give me all you got on
Bruce Wayne.

CUT TO:

EXT. BRUCE'S ESTATE - RIDING STABLES - SUNDOWN

Bruce and Vicki GALLOP UP on horseback. They dismount;
Bruce grooms his horse. Vicki watches.

VICKI
You're not bad on a horse.

BRUCE
Horses love me. I keep falling
OFF. Maybe that's why they love
me. You should see me, I'm one
big mass of bruises.

VICKI
(laughing)
Maybe we can arrange a little
examination?

Bruce, without missing a beat, puts the curry comb up on
a rail and turns to her.

BRUCE
Yeah, how about right now?

Vicki is caught in her own sexual trap.

VICKI
Just kidding.

BRUCE
You thought you had me, didn't
you?

Bruce smiles and walks past her up to the main house.
Vicki smiles.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - PATIO - SUNDOWN

A broad patio behind the manor, looking out on the es-
tate. Bruce and Vicki ARRIVE from the stables. Alfred
APPEARS with a bottle of champagne, smiles discreetly at
Vicki, then DISAPPEARS. Bruce POPS the cork unhandily.

ALFRED
The historical Society called to
remind you of the banquet. Should
I say you'll be there?

BRUCE
Yes, absolutely... I'll be there.

Alfred starts to walk away. Bruce thinks.

BRUCE
Alfred... Which Society?

ALFRED
Historical.

BRUCE
Oh, yeah, right. Yes.

Alfred EXITS.

VICKI
That Alfred's great.

BRUCE
I can't find my socks without
him. Been with the family since
I was born.

Pouring, he tries, unsuccessfully to stifle a yawn.

VICKI
(amused, teasing him)
Am I keeping you up?

BRUCE
(slightly embarrassed)
I'm sorry. I've got a lot going
on at the moment.

VICKI
Like who?

BRUCE
(flustered)
No... Just business... I'll be
honest with you, I bore myself
silly, tell me about you.

VICKI
I take pictures. And I love doing
it. I feel naked without a camera.

BRUCE
(little smile)
Well we better get you one.
(as she smiles)
Go on.

VICKI
I'd been floating around for a
while, doing fashion. It was
alright... I don't know. Things
change.
(searching for an
explanation)
How old are you?

BRUCE
Just turned 35.

VICKI
You've probably had it happen too.
You know... you wake up one
morning and say, hey this is who
I am. I see things through
cameras. All kinds of things.
Not just long legs and great
skirts, but... things... You know?

BRUCE
I'm not sure.

VICKI
Well... I just picked up and left.

BRUCE
What did you see?

VICKI
(sigh, BEAT)
A lot'a hotels. A little terror. A
little love once in a blue moon.

BRUCE
(pandering it)
A little terror. A little love.

VICKI
(softly)
It's out there. I was never in
the right place I guess.

Bruce looks around at his opulent estate, falls SILENT.

VICKI
You're a little elusive, Mr.
Wayne. I feel like there's a lot
going on in there.

BRUCE
Oh... not really.

VICKI
Come on, say what you're thinking.

BRUCE
I was just thinking how beautiful
you looked on that horse... and
that... it's kinda nice to have
someone here who notices things.

She finds herself irrevocably drawn in.

VICKI
(mischievous; offer-
ing her hand)
See... I do have an extraordinary
eye.

BRUCE
(taking her hand)
Two.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

A vast, darkened entry hall, framed by long semicircular
stairways on either side. Bruce and Vicki enter; she's
giddy.

VICKI
I feel like I'm in Paris in the
'30s. Is this fair? I'm half
drunk and you're not even --

BRUCE
Two drinks and I'm flying.

Vicky smiles. They stare into each other's eyes for a
moment, on the verge of kissing.

He's struggling with something. She touches him.

VICKY
Why are you afraid of flying?

He steps towards her and they begin a kiss which turns
into a passionate embrace. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING trans-
ports us to:

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a waterfront
rathole.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

TIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages. The patient sits
erect in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy para-
phernalia of an unlicensed gangland doctor.

The DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret, steps up with a
pair of scissors.

DOCTOR
Well, let's see how we did.

He begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we
get:

JACK NAPIER'S POV

The last strands of gauze peel back. The DOCTOR stands
there, looking at his handiwork. His mouth falls open.
His eyes bug out. He GASPS.

JACK (O.S.)
Mirror.

The DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock-
still, apparently transfixed by the sight of Jack's face.

JACK (O.S.)
Mirror.

ANGLE ON DOCTOR

He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand
mirror, and passes it OUT OF FRAME to Jack.

We hear a GASP and SOB. Two beats. Then, the sound of
GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to the floor. The
DOCTOR gulps hard.

DOCTOR
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed -- Mr.
Napier --

Jack begins to LAUGH. The DOCTOR turns uneasily away,
gestures apologetically at his seedy equipment.

DOCTOR
-- You see what I had to work
with here --

More laughter. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with
one hand, whining now, not daring to look at Jack.

DOCTOR
-- I'm sure that with proper recon
-- recon -- reconstructive
surgery --

A DOOR SLAMS. Jack is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes
a sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating
table as Jack's AWFUL LAUGH ECHOES in the hall outside.

DOCTOR
(puzzled)
What's so funny?

INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Vicki is asleep. CAMERA PANS TO Bruce lying next to her.
He's silently looking at the cascade of her hair on the
pillow. He watches her face, perplexed. Grandfather
CLOCK CLANGS. He checks his watch, stands up and looks
out window. He's constrained. He stretches impatiently.

ON CLOCK FACE

TIME HAS PASSED. PAN TO VICKI -- sleeping. A RHYTHMIC
SOUND. She stirs, half-wakes. CAMERA PANS to see Bruce,
upside-down, SLIGHTLY SWAYING in inversion boots.

INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

The private elevator HISSES open. JACK steps out,
bundled up in a trenchcoat, muffler, and slouch hat --
his face concealed from view. He plops in the big plush
swivel chair behind Grissom's desk.

GRISSOM (O.S.)
That you, sugar bumps?

Grissom WADDLES IN fresh out of the shower, a towel
wrapped around him. Using a smaller towel to dry his
hair, it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up figure
at his desk.

GRISSOM
Who the hell are you?

JACK
It's me. "Sugar Bumps."

GRISSOM
Jack?
(advancing
cautiously)
Thank God you're alive. I heard
you'd been...

JACK
Fried. Is that what you heard?

Jack stands and gestures him over to the empty chair.
Grissom moves when he sees the gun pointing at his belly.

JACK
YOU SET ME UP!
(beat)
Over a girl. You must be insane!

Grissom surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.

JACK
Don't bother.

GRISSOM
Your life won't be worth spit.

JACK
I been dead once already. It's
very liberating -- You have to
think of it as therapy.

GRISSOM
(beginning to panic)
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --

JACK
Jack? Jack's dead, my friend.
You can call me Joker.

He flings away the hat. RIPS THE MUFFLER from his face.
And -- as Grissom gasps in shock -- stands revealed in
his full horrendous glory.

His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous
seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from
the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS,
PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.

JACK
And as you can see, I'm much
happier.

Jack begins to GIGGLE, building to hysterical LAUGHTER.
Grissom makes a lunge towards his desk drawer. Jack
FIRES. AND FIRES AGAIN UNTIL THE CLIP IS EMPTY.

EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT

We TILT UP the facade of the skyscraper, arriving finally
at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW spiderwebbed with
cracks where Jack's bullets hit.

INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Darkness. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from this moment
on, The JOKER -- sits in Grissom's swivel chair and
surveys the moon-drenched city.

JOKER
(nostalgically)
Gotham City. It always brings
a smile to my face.

As he swivels in the chair he notices a copy of the Globe
(now blood-splattered) lying on Grissom's desk. The head-
line catches his eye. WINGED FREAK TERRORIZES GOTHAM'S
GANGLAND. He picks up the paper and starts HUMMING.

JOKER
Watch it, Batman. Wait'll they
get a load of me.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Bruce is asleep, his legs over the back of a chaise
lounge. Vicki is dressing. Alert.

VICKI
Bruce. I'm late, but I've a
proposition.

Bruce sits up wearily.

VICKI
I'll make us lunch tomorrow.
At my apartment. I'll show you
same of my photos. Will you come?

He's stretching. A hesitation flashes in his eyes.

BRUCE
Sure. Oh no... I -- I can't make
it.

Vicki stops brushing her hair. Checks out his vibes.

VICKI
Oh. Is anything wrong?

BRUCE
No -- I -- I've got a real
important meeting.

VICKI
Well... later in the day?

BRUCE
No... I... I've got to leave town
for a few days.

Vicki wonders, but continues.

VICKI
Well... when you get back.

Bruce thinks. No answer. Not wanting too much vulner-
ability herself, she lightens it up.

VICKI
Hey, I've got to get moving. See
you.

She pecks him on the cheek and breezes by him.

BRUCE
Yeah. I'll see you.

DOOR SHUTS. Bruce thinks.

IN HALLWAY - ON ALFRED

Alfred shows her out the door.

ALFRED
So nice to see you again, Miss
Vale.

VICKI
Yeah. I guess I'll see you when
you guys get back.

ALFRED
Back, ma'am? We're here for quite
a while I believe.

VICKI
Oh... never mind. See you.

But she noticed. And it hurt a little. Bruce was lying.

INT. ALICIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alicia, with an armload of dress bags, ENTERS -- and is
startled by a VOICE FROM BEHIND.

JOKER (O.S.)
Honey!

She pivots. Her eyes widen. She SHRIEKS.

Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair is The Joker. He's
in a smoking jacket and slippers, reading the paper, a
dry martini at his side.

JOKER
You wouldn't believe what happened
to me today.

Alicia faints.

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

GANGLORDS stare at Joker at the head of the table.

JOKER (O.S.)
So that's how it is, gentlemen.
Until Grissom resurfaces... I'm
the acting President. And I say
we start with this Anniversary
festival and run this city into
the ground.

Joker's dressed in a big slouch hat. His FACE is layered
with flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.
But he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE. VINNIE RICORSO
is the smartest of the bunch. He doesn't believe Joker
for a minute.

RICORSO
Why don't we hear this from
Grissom?

ROTELLI
How come you re wearing that stupid
smirk?

JOKER
Because life's been good to me.

CARMINE ROTELLI, an exceptionally oily mobster, speaks up:

ROTELLI
What if we say no?

JOKER
Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If
we can't do business, we shake
hands... and that's it.

ROTELLI
Yeah?

JOKER
Yeah.

ROTELLI stands up and extends a hand. Joker shakes.
A JOY BUZZER's concealed in Joker's palm.

40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops
back into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out
from his sleeves and shirt collar.

A SQUAD OF ARMED THUGS BURSTS INTO THE ROOM. These THUGS
have all been specially selected and distinctively STYLED
by the JOKER. (NOTE: these are the first of Joker's
creations We now begin to see Joker restyling every-
thing in his world.)

BOB's now Joker's number two man, staying close to him.

JOKER
Carmine got a little hot under the
collar.

The Joker begins to LAUGH at his own joke.

RICORSO
(getting up to leave)
... You're insane!

JOKER
(affronted innocence)
Haven't you heard of the healing
power of laughter?

He begins to LAUGH again, removes his hat and mops sweat
from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE FLESH --
to the bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.

JOKER
Now GET OUT OF HERE -- And give it
some thought.

Gangsters are ESCORTED OUT by the Joker's thugs. Joker
grabs a copy of the Globe.

JOKER
Bob, I want you to take a camera
and follow this reporter Knox.
Find out what he knows about
Batman. You got to learn to USE
people, Bob.

BOB
Yes sir.

BOB EXITS, leaving the JOKER alone with the charred
corpse of ROTELLI. The Joker ADDRESSES THE BODY.

JOKER
Your pals, they're not such bad
guys. What d'you say we give 'em
a couple of days to come round?
(pause; apparently
listening to the
corpse)
No?
(listens again)
Grease 'em now?
(seems shocked)
Okay.
(shakes his head mock
sorrowfully)
You're a vicious bastard, Rotelli.
I'm glad you're dead.

INT. NEWSPAPER MORGUE - DAY

Vicki looks through filing cabinets. She's intense.
Over her shoulder a FILE APPEARS with BRUCE WAYNE on it.
Knox has it.

VICKI
I'm looking for that.

She grabs it and looks through the very thin file.

KNOX
I thought we were a team here.
I'm losing confidence in you --
going out with this weirdo.

VICKY
Speaking strictly professionally
right? This wouldn't be personal
issue for you would it?

KNOX
I just want you to do your job.

VICKI
I AM doing my job.

KNOX
Me too. I'm protecting my partner.
The guy collects weird weapons in
Japan, probably roller skates
through the female population like
a bulldozer.

VICKI
Where does it say that, Knox?
There's nothing in this file but
social puffery. No photos, no
history. Nothing. That's strange.
Where's he get his money? What's
he do all day? Who is he?

She tosses the file on the floor angrily. EXITS.

KNOX
Who cares?

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NEXT MORNING

Vicki in car a block from the Manor. She looks through
her telephoto lens. After a few BEATS -- Bruce Wayne
emerges from the gates, walking. He's dressed incognito.
He carries a package.

Vicki FOLLOWS him.

CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION THROUGH:

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY

As Bruce walks through the city. He puts on sunglasses
and seems interested in not being seen.

Vicki follows along, at a distance.

EXT. BAD STREET - DAY

The neighborhood is now bad. Few people are around.
Bruce ENTERS a blind alley.

Vicki steals up to corner to see what he's doing.

EXT. BLIND ALLEY - DAY

Bruce looks at the trash-scattered alley. He looks up
at the sky, then down at a corner. He kicks away a Coke
can, cleans off a spat.

ON VICKI

puzzled she raises her camera.

ON BRUCE

He unwraps the package.

Vicki strains to see what he's holding.

Bruce moves a bit and reveals TWO LONG-STEMMED ROSES.

Vicki raises camera and SOFTLY CLICKS THE SHUTTER.

ON BRUCE

He kneels and places the roses as if at a shrine. He
holds his hand on his eyes for a BEAT.

Vicki looks and CLICKS again. What is he doing?

ON BRUCE

He stands and kicks the can back out toward the street.
He heads out the alley. Where's Vicki? When he passes
by where she was. She's gone.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

Bruce walks down Broad Street which leads into the City
Square.

CAMERA LINGERS -- Vicki follows at a distance.

ON BRUCE

As he enters the City Square.

A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside him, feeling his
way along an imaginary wall. He is not very good at it,
and in spite of his heavy makeup you can tell that he's
rather ugly.

A COMMOTION catches Bruce's eye. He steps back to the
edge of the gathered crowd.

EXT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT

RICORSO -- the CRIMELORD from the boardroom -- emerges
flanked by a LAWYER and a pair of BODYGUARDS. They're
met by a group of REPORTERS. Including Knox.

ON VICKI

She peers around. Looking for Bruce. Can't see him.

REPORTER
So what is this affidavit you've
filed? Grissom gave you all of
his businesses?

RICORSO
Mr. Grissom asked me, as a personal
favor, to take over the operation
of his businesses until he returned.

KNOX
Jeezez, that's a pretty big gift.
You must have been VERY close.
Did you do a little time together
as children?

Ricorso sneers. OTHERS LAUGH.

KNOX
I smell fresh ink, guys. I'm sure
you can prove all this? Why am I
asking? Of course you can.

ANGLE ON VICKI

Getting closer.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Something catches his eye.

HIS POV - A HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES

converging on the scene. Something's very wrong. (These
are Joker's men.)

Vicki ARRIVES next to Knox.

ANGLE ON BOB

taking photos of Knox and Vicki from edge of the crowd.

ON LAWYER - TIGHT

LAWYER
We have witnesses.
Grissom's signature is perfectly
legitimate.

VOICE (O.S.)
It's legitimate! I saw him. I
was THERE!

Crowd parts as a LARGE MIME steps up to Ricorso. Ricorso
frowns.

NEW GUY
I saw it all, he raised his dead
hand and signed the paper in his
own blood. And he did it with
this pen!

Mime pulls out a ridiculously long quill pen. Ricorso
gapes in puzzlement at him.

TIGHT ON NEW GUY

Underneath the white skull cap -- it's the Joker.

JOKER
(lifting his wig)
Hello, Vinnie -- it's me, your
uncle Bingo, time to pay the
check!

Joker HURLS the sharp-tipped pen right into Ricorso's
throat. Ricorso falls, clutching his throat.

Someone SCREAMS, reporters SCATTER as MIMES FIRE MACHINE
GUNS IN THE AIR.

Vicki dives behind a parked car. She looks back to see
Bruce, standing frozen, rooted to the ground. He's
watching, transfixed.

Mayhem prevails.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

BRUCE is still frozen to the spot and exposed to the
"mimes."

A FEW FEET AWAY

Vicki crouches behind the car and beckons to him.

VICKI
Bruce! Get DOWN!

He totally ignores her and BEGINS TO WALK. At first
slowly, then faster, right toward the Joker.

ANGLE ON BODYGUARDS

ON JOKER

He LAUGHS at the DIN and walks as if immortal through the
mayhem. (He never sees Bruce.)

ON BRUCE

He's walking the same way, still at a distance from
Joker. But his recognition of him is growing.

ON JOKER

He reaches his car. DRIVER rushes to get him out of
there.

Bruce now gets close enough to see Joker's face through
the window. Joker's car SPEEDS AWAY past him.

Other cars containing other mimes SPEED AWAY, too. A
SILENCE DESCENDS. Only the SOUNDS OF CRYING and ebbing
fear.

Bruce stands looking after Joker.
Suddenly Vicki is there.

VICKI
Bruce...?

No answer. He hardly seems to notice she is there.

Bruce turns to her. Sweat pouring down his face. Looks
right into her eyes. She looks at him and sees the signs
of deep trauma in his eyes.

BRUCE
I'm sorry, Vicki...

He turns and DISAPPEARS into the crowd.

VICKI
Bruce!

CUT TO:

INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

A TV CREW broadcasting live from the massacre site.

The minicam angle WIDENS to include HARVEY DENT and the
Mayor. The ANCHORWOMAN thrusts a mike in Mayor's face:

ANCHORWOMAN
Does this gang war dampen the
city's plans for the 200th
anniversary festival?

MAYOR
The festival opens. The police
are going to stop these gangsters.

ANCHORWOMAN
Mr. Dent, what do you think of
the theory that the mysterious
'Batman' is a mob enforcer killing
these men?

Suddenly there is a terrific SCREAM OF RAGE from O.S.
and the TV SCREEN SHATTERS.

JOKER'S BOARD ROOM

The CAMERA PULLS BACK from the smashed and smoking TV,
placing us in the JOKER's BOARD ROOM.

JOKER's in his swivel chair holding an extendible/re-
tractable pincer on the end of which is a boxing glove
making a fist. By squeezing the handle of this he has
punched the "fist" through the TV screen. BOB ENTERS.

JOKER
(furious)
Batman! BATMAN! Can somebody
please tell me what kind of a
world we live in where a man
dressed as a bat gets my airtime!?
This city needs an enema!

He STORMS OUT of the office into:

INT. AXIS CHEMICAL COMPANY - DAY

LOW ANGLE ON the JOKER. He rushes along a catwalk high
above the refinery floor. He passes a COUPLE OF UGLY,
CRIMINALLY-MINDED SCIENTISTS in white coats, holding
sheets of calculations.

JOKER
(SHOUTING over the
noise)
Have we shipped a million of these
things?

SCIENTIST
Yes SIR!

JOKER
Ship it all. Untangle the knots,
roll the wheels, I've got my blood
up!

The Scientists look at each other and RUSH into action.

Joker BANGS OPEN THE DOOR TO:

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - DAY

A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Axis Chemical.
Joker is HUMMING, insanely.

THE CAMERA TRAVELS PAST collages of photographs; each
photograph cut from scenes of war.

The CAMERA CONTINUES DOWN a stack of folders. On one
document are the initials C.I.A. On the front of the
folder can be read "DDID NERVE GAS -- RESULTS OF
PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION" and stamped across it,
"DISCONTINUED 1977." Finally, we see the photos of dead
soldiers, lips drawn back in chemical-induced grimaces.

JOKER
Losing is a bad habit, Bob. So
much to do and so little time.

BOB STEALS IN and offers some photographs.

BOB
Here's the photos.

Joker looks them over.

TIGHT ON PHOTOS

Joker shuffles through. Stops on Knox.

JOKER
Who's this dud?

BOB
That's Knox.

JOKER
Bad tie. No style.

ON A PHOTO OF VICKI WITH KNOX

JOKER
Stop the press!! Who is that?

BOB
That's Vicki Vale, she's the
photographer working with Knox.

TIGHT ON JOKER

He's licking his lips. Looking Vicki up and down.

JOKER
THAT WOMAN has style!! Jeezus
Marimba! A lovely beast like
that could get a man up and
running.

The JOKER, excitedly HUMMING AWAY begins to cut Vicki's
picture out of the others. Leaving a border around her.
He then fills in border with crayons.

BOB
She's been dating some guy named
Wayne.

JOKER
She's gonna trade up! Damn! It's
hard to stay inside the lines!

Joker pastes Vicki's picture onto a board.

JOKER
I'm gonna get me a NEW girl,
Bobbie.

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the JOKER is sur-
rounded, wall to wall, by a collage of pictures of war
and destruction. The huge collage forms a birds-eye-
view map of Gotham.

JOKER
I've got a mind to make some
mayhem. Phone book!

INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S STUDY - DAY

Alfred uses a feather duster. BRUCE ENTERS, obviously
distraught and exhausted. Very concerned, Alfred takes
his coat and hands Bruce a hot towel. Bruce wipes his
hands.

ALFRED
Miss Vale called. She was rather
concerned.
(matchmaking a bit)
I've noticed that there is a
certain weight that lifts when
she's here.

BRUCE
Why don't you marry her, Alfred?

ALFRED
That's not exactly what I had in
mind, sir.

BRUCE
I can't go on with that, Alfred.
(as Alfred nods)
Napier's alive. He's running
Grissom's men. I gotta find out
everything the police have on him.

ALFRED
Yes, sir.

BRUCE
She's good isn't she?

Bruce smiles. Alfred smiles sadly, too.

INT. VICKI' S APARTMENT - DAY (THAT MOMENT)

Puzzled, Vicki looks through her photos of Bruce and
his flowers.

ON SEVERAL PHOTOS

of Bruce along his puzzling route.

TILT UP: Vicki dials Knox.

VICKI
Allie. I want you to check
something for me. Okay? Find out
what's so special about the alley
at Pearl and Phillips Streets.
'Bye.

She hangs up. Looks at photos.

VICKI
What's up with you, Mr. Wayne?

PHONE RINGS. SHE PICKS IT UP.

TONY (V.O.)
Vicki, this is Tony. We have a
session scheduled and the client
INSISTS that you shoot it.

VICKI
Me? Tony, I'm kind of busy.

TONY (V.O.)
The client says he has information
about Batman.

Vicki puzzles. Chews her lip.

VICKI
Batman? When's the session?

TONY (V.O.)
This afternoon at 3:00.

VICKI
Alright, I'll be there.

She hangs up and thinks.

INT. PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO - DAY

ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion: mascara, blusher,
eyeliner, lipstick. BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their
makeup mirrors as VICKI wanders past.

In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular
British art director, is dressing a swimsuit layout with
two SUPERMODEL5. They all AD LIB GREETINGS to VICKI.

TONY
Come on, girls, magic Vicki is
here. Shine it. Think of the
money. That's it.

Vicki gets out her camera.

VICKI
Tony. Who's this client that
knows about Batman?

TONY
Never met him. All I know is
he pays cash.

VICKI
What's his name?

TONY
Mr. Kerr.

VICKI
Mr. Kerr? What's his first name?

TONY
Joseph, Joe Kerr.

A look of fear comes over Vicki's face.

As Vicki looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place
simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.

TONY
Jesus! Hurry up! Vicki's
expensive. Show her some bones.

Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is
unnatural, involuntary. Vicki, sensing that something is
terribly wrong, lays a hand on Tony's arm.

The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, go into VIOLENT
SPASMS.

TONY
Is this some sort of joke? -- OH
MY GOD!

The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering convul-
sively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN,
CHEMICAL-WARFARE-TYPE GRINS. Vicki GASPS.

CUT TO:

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

The "ACTION NEWS" set, with anchors BECKY NARITA and
PETER McELROY.

BECKY
The fashion world was stunned
today by the sudden deaths of
models Candy Walker and Amanda
Keeler. Cause of death has been
attributed to a violent allergic
reaction, although authorities
have not ruled out the possibility
of drug use. Peter?

PETER
... and plans continue for the
city's 200th birthday as Mayor
Borg announced the unveiling of a
statue of John T. Gotham, Gotham's
founder --

A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper INTO FRAME.

PETER
This just in. Three mysterious
deaths at a beauty parlor in --

Off to the left, BECKY begins to LAUGH. PETER FROWNS.

PETER
Becky! This is hardly the --
(his eyes widen)
BECKY!!

An O.S. CRASH. PETER jumps out of his seat, mouth agape
in horror.

BECKY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS RIGHT AND
LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS UNCONTROL-
LABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.

TECHNICIANS rush the sound stage in a frenzy. BECKY
spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the news
desk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the
grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face.

PETER
KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE --

Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A
moment later, we're looking at:

SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS

Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS
as a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up
underneath.

MODELS
(cartoon voice)
... Love that Joker!

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

MUSIC CONTINUES as a deranged pitchman -- The Joker --
pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. He waves
merrily in time to the music.

INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has been
JAMMED. Every monitor shows the Joker's PROMO.

DIRECTOR
WHERE'S IT COMING FROM??

TECHNICIAN
I DON'T KNOW!

CLOSEUP - THE JOKER

He thrusts a brightly-colored package AT the CAMERA.

JOKER
... new improved Joker brand.
With my secret sauce... SMYLEX!
(a sweep of the hand)
Let's go to our blind taste test.

TIGHT ON ANONYMOUS MAN

GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied to his chair, squirming,
struggling. On the table before him is a package label-
led "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: "NOT AN
ACTOR."

JOKER
Ooh. He's not happy! He's been
using Brand X! But with new
improved Joker brand...

ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his
chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.

JOKER
... I get a GRIN -- AGAIN AND
AGAIN!!

INT. GOTHAM BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

A YOUNG MAN watching TV as he dresses for a date. He's
got an aerosol deodorant poised under one arm. He looks
down at the can, suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?

INSERT - TV SCREEN - THE JOKER

Lounging beside a full-sized photo of a Jokerized SWIM-
SUIT MODEL -- with GREEN HAIR and CHALK-WHITE FLESH.

JOKER
That luscious tan, those ruby lips
-- and hair color so natural, only
your undertaker knows for sure!

INT. GOTHAM KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable as
MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then
FREEZE with their forks in midair.

EXT. STREET - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT

DELIVERY TRUCKS, bearing colorful manufacturers' logos,
drive through the city bringing tainted products to
market.

JOKER (V.O.)
I know what you're saying. Where
can I buy these fine new items?
-- Well, that's the deal, folks,
chances are... you've bought 'em
already!

INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

Bruce tired, is glued to the tube. Onscreen, the Joker
leers -- gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.

JOKER (V.O.)
So if you did... remember, put on
a happy face!!

MUSIC TAG (V.O.)
(SINGING)
Joker Brand. We're changing the
face of -- Gooootham!

MUSIC UP. VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed
transmission ends. Alfred ENTERS, adds something to the
folder in front of Bruce. Bruce reads.

BRUCE
Assault with deadly weapon age 15. Nice guy.
(continues looking)
Psychological testing -- high
intelligence, unstable, aptitudes
science, chemistry and -- art.
Chemistry?

ON BRUCE

He looks at a photo of Napier.

BRUCE
Let's go shopping, Alfred.

SERIES OF SHOTS

-- The Gotham Globe cartwheeling INTO FRAME:

PANIC GRIPS GOTHAM
Contaminated Products Claim 13 Lives
WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS "JOKER"?

-- An ANCH0RWOMAN on the evening news. Her complexion
is curiously sallow. BLACK BAGS show under her eyes.

ANCHORWOMAN
... six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

-- An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:

ANCHORMAN
-- and what is the pattern?
Foods, alcohol, or beauty and
hygiene products. Cologne,
mouthwash, underarm deodorant --

-- The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100 percent
natural. Her hair is frizzy. Her eyebrows are miss-
ing altogether. Every wrinkle on her face is plainly
visible.

ANCHORWOMAN
Or worse yet, there may BE no
pattern. The search goes on
through Gotham's shopping nightmare.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DENT'S OFFICE - DAY

The Mayor is distraught. Dent is on the phone.

MAYOR
We're having this festival if I
have to carry a shotgun and get
people there myself.

Dent hangs up.

MAYOR
Do you hear the words coming out
of my mouth, Dent? The festival
is ON. You find out what this
madman is poisoning us with and
fast. DO I make myself CLEAR?

Mayor catches a glimpse of himself in mirror. Checks to
see that HIS mouth isn't grimacing.

DENT
We're working on it.

INT. ARMORY - DAY

Alfred oils a blow gun. Bruce ENTERS.

ALFRED
Oh, sir, did you see the message
from Miss Vale. She'll be ten
minutes late in meeting you at the
museum.

Bruce puzzles.

BRUCE
Am I... I'm not meeting her...?

INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

A bone white hand pats a white cheek. The Joker's rinsed
his hair black and is applying makeup. He's done it
before, many times. He's getting ready for a date. A
drugged voice intrudes.

ALICIA (O.S.)
Jack? Where are you going?

As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of
Alicia, her face is covered by a shiny white porcelain
doll's mask.

JOKER
Daddy's going to make some art.

INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT

A few PATRONS are viewing paintings in a square, open
atrium, enclosed on all four sides by a BALCONY. One
story up, overlooking the atrium, there's a TEA ROOM --
an airy, fern-filled dining room popular with tourists.

INT. FLUEGELHEIM - TEA ROOM - NIGHT

Vicki enters with her camera bag and portfolio -- ready
for a confrontation with Bruce.

VICKI
I'm Vicki Vale -- I had a message
to meet Bruce Wayne here.

MAITRE D'
Yes, he has not arrived. We have
a table waiting.

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER)

Vicki sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A
WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper,
bearing a single word: URGENT.

WAITER
Miss Vale, this just arrived for
you.

As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside
is a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.

DEAR V. VALE,
PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.

Vicki opens the box to find a MINIATURE GAS MASK.

A strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, PURPLE SMOKE
billows from air-conditioning vent.

TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out.
ART LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.

Vicki hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth.
Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.

INT. MUSEUM - ATRIUM - THAT MOMENT

PURPLE SMOKE plumes up as we TILT DOWN toward the floor
of the atrium. PATRONS lie sprawled on the floor,
twisted at odd angles, out cold.

The doors BURST OPEN and IN WALKS Joker, looking dapper
in his street makeup and BIG PURPLE POP ARTIST'S HAT.
He is surrounded by his entourage of UGLY GOONS. One is
carrying a huge GHETTO BLASTER which is thumping out
MUSIC, others are toting battles of champagne and glasses,
and all have cans of aerosol paint sticking out of their
packets. This is a moving nonstop party. The Joker
wanders past the artwork examining it with an apprecia-
tive eye.

JOKER
Okay, everybody, let's broaden our
minds.

Stepping over collapsed PATRONS, he stops at "BLUE BOY"
and holds up a PEARL-HANDLED CANE to get a better
perspective. Then he pulls a THIN, SHARP SWORD from the
head of the cane and carves a BIG JOKER SMILE in the
canvas.

Manet's barmaid, a Degas ballerina -- all get the Zorro
treatment. Behind him, his UGLY CRONIES go to work,
spraying paint on every canvas The Joker has missed.

He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."

JOKER
I kinda like this one. Leave it.

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT (MOMENT LATER)

Vicki at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared
as hell. The Joker saunters over and pulls up a chair.
He is flanked by TWO UGLY HENCHMEN, one carrying a pair
of CANDLESTICKS, the other, the GHETTO BLASTER.

JOKER
I think it's safe to take that off.

As Vicki, terrified, removes the gas mask, The Joker
signals to the two UGLY GOONS who swiftly place the
GHETTO BLASTER and CANDLESTICKS on the table and EXIT.

The Joker reaches for his lighter and switches on the
GHETTO BLASTER which produces romantic MUSIC. A LONG
JET OF FLAME shoots out of the lighter as he lights the
candles.

JOKER
(seductively)
You're beautiful.

VICKI
(nervous)
Thank you.

JOKER
In an old fashioned sort of way.
I'm sure we can make you more --
today.

The Joker moves his chair a little closer to Vicki.

JOKER
THIS your portFOLIO!

VICKI
... Yes I'm meeting a friend who
I wanted to see my work...

He leafs through. Magazine covers of celebrities, heads
of state and exotic vistas.

JOKER
Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, craaap
... Ahhh. Now here's good work.

The COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.

JOKER
The skulls. The bodies. You give
it all such a glow.
(smirking)
I dunno if it's art, but I like it.

Vicki is squirming, but she doesn't care to argue with
him.

JOKER
(with deep sincerity;
into Vicki's eyes)
Let me tell you what I've got in
mind, Sweetie. I was in the
bathtub one day, when I realized
why I was destined for greatness.
You know how concerned most people
are about appearances. This is
pretty, that is not.
(shakes head)
Well, that's all over for me. In
crime the passions ripen fully.
Now I DO what others only DREAM
of. I do art, 'til somebody DIES.
See???
(bigger, insane)
I'm the world's first fully
functioning homicidal artist!!!

VICKI
What do you want?

JOKER
I want my face on the one-dollar
bill!

VICKI
(leaning away)
Good goal. I take it you're
joking.

JOKER
(suddenly furious,
he points to his
face)
DO I LOOK LIKE I'M JOKING?

As quickly as he has flared into rage The Joker calms
down again.

JOKER
(charming)
Look, we mustn't mistake ourselves
for regular people. We're ARTISTS.
For instance, let me challenge you
with a little piece I did. Bob,
Alicia.

He oozes twisted charm. He's coming on to her.

JOKER
You'll make a pictorial record of
my work. You'll be with me in the
avant garde.

VOICE (O.S.)
Jack?

ALICIA WANDERS IN, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wear-
ing the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.

ALICIA
You said I could watch you improve
the paintings.

JOKER
(rolling his eyes)
Oh I'm in trouble now!

Vicki can't take her eyes off this strange figure.

VICKI
Why is she wearing a mask?

JOKER
Well, she's just a sketch really.
Alicia! Come here, have a seat.
Show the lady why you wear the
mask.

Alicia sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.

JOKER
You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's been
made over in line with my new
philosophy. Now, like me, she's
a living work of art.

We're looking at Alicia's profile as the mask comes off.
The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. But
the side we can't see... SENDS Vicki RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.
Vicki lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE
FROZEN IN HORROR.

JOKER
(modestly)
I'm no Picasso. You LIKE IT?

Vicki tips a chair in his path. Horrified, she tries to
placate him.

VICKI
It's great. But what can I do for
you? I...

JOKER
(miming it out)
A little song... a little dance...
and Batman's head upon a lance.
Tell me what you know about...

He makes a flapping with his hands indicating Batman.

VICKI
I don't know anything about Batman.

JOKER
(getting sexy)
Really, well, what do you think
about a little 'you and me'?

VICKI
I think you're insane.

JOKER
I am? I thought I was a Pisces!
(brightly)
C'mon, let's make up. Here's a
flower.

There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He
holds it up for Vicki's inspection as he moves menacingly
closer.

VICKI
NO!

The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR
LIQUID spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.

She GASPS, BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises
from the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.

Vicki backs into a WAITER'S CART. Her hand closes around
a pitcher. She FLINGS IT at the JOKER'S HEAD -- DOUSING
HIS FACE WITH WATER.

His hands go up and he doubles over, SHRIEKING, MAKEUP
running through his fingers and onto his suit.

JOKER
(like the Wicked Witch
of the West dissolving)
NO! NO! I'M MELTING! I'M
MELTING! OH GOD! I'M MELTING!
HELP ME!

Vicki is appalled. She moves towards him. Her instinct,
in spite of everything, is to help him in his suffering.
As she gets close to him and extends a hand, he leaps up
abruptly, taking his hands from his "melting" face, ex-
posing the HIDEOUS RAVAGED MESS beneath the makeup.

JOKER
(gleefully)
BOO!

He advances on Vicki.

And then -- suddenly -- A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS. A CAPED
SHADOW drops to the floor of the tea-room. And all at
once, The Joker finds himself face to face with Batman!

On BATMAN's wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. He aims it at
THE JOKER. The Joker stiffens, thinking he's about to
be shot. THE BATMAN then fires the gauntlet, the barrel
of which splits in two before sending two metal spikes on
wires in opposite directions, either side of The Joker.

The metal spikes embed themselves in walls on both sides
of the atrium, creating an escape wire for THE BATMAN.
In the wink of an eye he grabs Vicki and plunges over
the balcony, leaving The Joker stunned with amazement.

INT. MUSEUM - ATRIUM - THAT MOMENT

The JOKER'S UGLY GOONS can only gape in awe as Batman and
Vicki swoop past -- swinging across the floor and STRAIGHT
THROUGH AN ARCHED DOORWAY labelled "EXIT."

JOKER
(recovering)
Those toys! Where does he get
those wonderful toys?
(to the Goons)
Well don't just stand there! GO
AND ASK HIM!!!!

THE GOONS charge off.

EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - NIGHT (MOMENT LATER)

A SIGN on a black metal stand -- "CLOSED FOR THE DAY" --
HURTLES through the glass doors. Batman and Vicki
HUSTLE THROUGH; he points her to a side alley. Batman
lobs a SMOKE PELLET into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.

BATMAN
GET IN THE CAR!

VICKI
WHICH CAR?

Vicki suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while
there are many cars parked along the side alley -- there
is only one BATMOBILE.

VICKI
... Oh.

The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well, inde-
scribable. Vicki climbs in and is dazzled by a stunning
array of electronic gadgetry.

BATMAN
Ignition!

As he sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the
dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny,
synthesized VOICE repeats the command:

COMPUTER (V.O.)
Ignition.

The engines are REVVING UP as BATMAN vaults in.

JOKER'S GOONS stumble hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke.
They scatter as the BATMOBILE barrels out of the alley.

Choking GOONS climb into their van and two cars.

EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER

The BATMOBILE disappears round a corner in a cloud of
dust.

EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER

PEDESTRIANS scatter as the Joker's two goon cars swerve
hard left and barrel through a crowded intersection.

EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER

BATMOBILE approaches intersection at high speed. The
right-side indicator begins to flash. It seems incredible
that at this velocity Batman should think it possible to
make a right-angle turn. As the BATMOBILE draws level
with the corner a spike with a wire attached to it
rockets out of the side of the vehicle and embeds itself
in a wall. This enables the BATMOBILE to turn the corner
without slowing down or spinning off across the inter-
section. Having completed the turn, the wire separates
from the car which continues without losing speed.

INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

ONLOOKERS gawk as the sleek supercar rips up the pavement.

BATMAN
Damn!

EXT. BLIND ALLEY - NIGHT

Into a blind alley. Batmobile doesn't slow down. Bat-
mobile SPINS ON ITS AXIS 180 DEGREES and goes back where
it came from.

EXT. DOWN ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT

Batmobile moving up on an empty block -- a night construc-
tion team. A huge piece of heavy machinery backs up
slowly and inexorably, blocking the intersection.

Batman GUNS THE ENGINE. Swerves left. Tries to glide
past. And hits the brakes -- stopping inches short of
a head-on collision with a lamppost!

He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. ON-
LOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS cluster around them: the
JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.

VICKI
Can't we --

BATMAN
Too many people. Come on!
(as she scrambles
out)
SHIELDS!!

The BATMOBILE'S computerized VOICE replies:

COMPUTER (V.O.)
Shields.

With a series of CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into
place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving
the BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK
METAL.

Batman and Vicki vault over construction debris.

INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

Three police cars, bubbles blazing, overtake the Joker's
van and bear down on the abandoned Batmobile. The
Joker's van does a U-turn and rumbles sedately off.

EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Batman and Vicki zigzag past storefronts and candy stands.

INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot Batman and Vicki coming
off the side street. The DRIVER shouts into a radio:

DRIVER
We got 'em!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Batman and Vicki race down the sidewalk. The car is
gaining on them. A SUDDEN SPRAY OF BULLETS shatters a
storefront.

BATMAN'S POV

He sees a RAGAMUFFIN LITTLE GIRL playwalking her doll
around the corner.

He rushes and slides on the street, pulling the girl out
of the way of a HAIL OF BULLETS.

ON LITTLE GIRL

She is wide-eyed. She holds up the dolly for Batman to
see.

LITTLE GIRL
Is it Halloween?

Batman smiles and rushes back to pick up Vicki from
behind a parked car. The GOONS DRIVE BY AGAIN. Batman
and Vicki RUN into a BLIND ALLEY.

INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

They watch the Goons glide past the mouth of the alley.
Batman looks up five stories, sees a catwalk.

BATMAN
How much do you weigh?

VICKI
... A hundred and eight?

He's doing some quick mental calculations when the CAR
reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue
of escape. Galvanized, Batman unfurls a rope, HEAVES A
BATARANG UPWARD, and grabs Vicki roughly about the waist.

BATMAN
HANG ON!

THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches on the
catwalk, and Batman triggers the spring-action REEL on
his utility belt.

BULLETS zing past as Batman and Vicki WHIP UPWARD like
fish on a line. One story; two stories; and then...

They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the
Joker's GOONS advance. Batman wriggles, twists. Vicki
SCREAMS.

Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism.
They're stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.

BATMAN
Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!

He's detached the reel from his own waist and hitched it
around Vicki's belt. He LETS GO.

Vicki rockets upward at blinding speed, SHRIEKING all the
way. Batman, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.

Vicki SLAMS up into the catwalk and bobs on the line as
Batman lands with a loud CRASH, overturning a row of
garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash. Batman
manages to slam two GOONS into a wall, but before he can
get to his feet, GOON III slams a lead pipe into the back
of his skull.

THUGS circle around him. The LEAD THUG holds his col-
leagues back, draws his gun, and fires TWO SHOTS, point-
blank, at the yellow-and-black INSIGNIA on Batman's
chest. The body jerks; they edge closer -- and stop.

GOON I
... No blood.

GOON II
Jesus. Who is it? Check his
wallet.

GOON III
Wait a minute.

GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the
body. He examines THE Batman's TUNIC.

GOON IV
What is that?

GOON III
Some kind of body armor.

GOON I
He's human after all -- Take the
mask off.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

VICKI has pulled herself up onto a roof. Down below, the
THUGS are removing Batman 5 cowl. But at this height --
and this angle -- she can't see his face. She reaches
for her CAMERA BAG.

ANGLE ON GOONS

Gaping at the shadowed unconscious face of BRUCE WAYNE.
(NOTE: WE never see his face, and THEY can't either.)

GOON I
Get out of the way, I can't see
him.

And at that very instant... A FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.

Startled, the thugs look up.

GOON III
Goddam, it's the girl!

ON VICKI

A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as
the GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang,
holds the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING
using her telephoto lens.

ON THE THUGS

No sight of Vicki. They begin to relax a little.

GOON II
Did you hit her?

GOON I
I think so. Wax him.

They turn their guns on Bruce. Ready to FIRE.

A GLOVED HAND snakes out, GRABS GOON I BY THE COATTAIL
and yanks him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II
has PULLED THE TRIGGER TWICE before he knows what's
happened.

In one fluid motion Bruce HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body
THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage
can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest
wall.

GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. On the way
down he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.

Four seconds after all this began, Batman is alone in the
alleyway with GOON IV.

GOON IV has his gun out, but he's shaking too much to
pull the trigger. Batman smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and
RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

Through all this, Vicki's camera has been poised on the
ledge, snapping away. Batman looks up.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

She peeks down at the alley. Limp goons everywhere.
And, in addition, Batman sees her.

ANGLE - ON VICKI

She thinks fast. She may have a clean photo of Batman's
face. She removes the roll, drops it down her blouse,
and ESCAPES across the roof.

EXT. ALLEY - ON BATMAN

Batman sees her disappear. He looks around, spots the
BATMOBILE two blocks away. The car is still there, the
chrome-steel shields intact. But DOZENS OF COPS and
CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL OVER the fearsome
machine. Batman snorts in frustration.

Just then, A GIANT THREE-TON CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up
the street toward the Batmobile. He's about to get towed.

He takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER from his utility belt:

BATMAN
Shields open.

EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From
within they hear the tinny computerized voice:

COMPUTER (V.O.)
Shields open.

The steel plates begin to retract.

BATMAN (V.O.)
(over radio)
Ignition.

COMPUTER (V.O.)
Ignition.

COP
There's somebody in there!

The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit -- then
TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO LIFE
and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.

COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there
stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances
toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes
dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.

PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.

CUT TO:

VICKI

running across rooftops, with much fear. She shimmies
down a ladder, only one roof to go to get to the street
and freedom. She hears SIRENS.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless
BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting,
dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of
COP CARS in hot pursuit.

ON VICKI

SHE'S COME TO AN OBSTACLE. It's a five-foot drop to the
street below. Vicki clambers down KERPLUNK and quickens
her pace, tossing a nervous glance over her shoulder
every couple of steps.

Then suddenly she walks smack into Batman.

BATMAN
Not even a 'thank you'?

VICKI
(embarrassed)
Well -- I think you might thank
me. You were as good as dead.

BATMAN
You weigh a little more than 103.

SIRENS APPROACH. Batman takes her gently by the
shoulders.

BATMAN
You'd better come with me.

VICKI
... Where are we going?

No reply.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

Street level. Batman emerges pulling Vicki.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

Batman sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner. With Vicki
in front of him, he STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE
ONRUSHING HEADLIGHTS.

BATMAN
STOP!

BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of
Batman and Vicki. A moment later Batman is AT THE WHEEL.

SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. THE COP CARS are now
visible behind them. Batman floors the pedal; the Bat-
mobile's powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless
cops KILL THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night
at 140 mph.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman drives down a deserted stretch of road lined by
ancient tall pines. Vicki tries to see out. Batman
pushes a button and changes the polarization of the
glass. She can't see out. He's stoic.

VICKI
This is kidnapping.

BATMAN
Looks like it.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT (MOMENT LATER)

Vicki studies Batman's face. He flicks a switch on
lights behind his head which dazzle Vicki, making it
impossible for her to see him.

Vicki frowns, looks through the windshield, and SEES --
much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL
LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.

Wide-eyed, she looks at Batman. Still smiling, he HITS
THE GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.

ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL

Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES ALTOGETHER -- revealing,
in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.

Batmobile ZOOMS through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL
-- which is nothing more than a MIRROR PROJECTION -- winks
back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Another world -- a vast, dank world of perpetual night,
unchanged by the centuries.

STALACTITES hang from walls. Cramped, craggy passageways
spiral off maze-like, descending into darkness.

And then -- an incongruous sight: vast banks of blinking
computers. A fully-equipped machine shop. A state-of-
the-art crime lab. This is THE BATCAVE.

Batman climbs out of the car. He keeps his distance from
Vicki. She steps from the Batmobile a little shaky.

DAPPLED POOLS OF LIGHT create an almost operatic stage for
Batman and Vicki to alternately hide and reveal themselves
in. Vicki steps carefully into the light. Trying to see
Batman better.

BATMAN
Watch your step in here.

Vicki stops just over the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She
kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound. She
looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair of
gymnast's rings. She backs away.

SUDDENLY Vicki's HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim
recesses overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.

VICKI
Bats. They're -- terrifying.

BATMAN
That's the idea.

Batman pats the cage of a WOUNDED BAT, its wing is
splinted.

BATMAN
They're also great survivors.

Vicki steps away, repulsed.

Batman is rustling papers. She can't see what he's doing.
She begins to examine a row of bat-suits hanging nearby.

VICKI
What are these made out of?

BATMAN
It doesn't have a name.

While he seems pleased at Vicki's fascination with his
lair, he nevertheless remains guarded. Vicki moves
toward Batman, intent on getting a close look at him.

VICKI
What are you going to do with me?

Batman, realizing what Vicki is trying to do, moves away
from her into shadow.

BATMAN
You're going to do something for
me.

Vicki again begins to approach Batman. Keeping in shadow,
he moves behind a lab table. On the table, amid the
beakers and test tubes, are dozens of TAINTED PRODUCTS:
makeup, deodorant, etc. Nearby, a COMPUTER PRINTER begins
to CHATTER; Vicki watches information scrolling across the
main monitor.

VICKI
(looking at the
tainted products)
What is all this?

Batman turns but keeps his face out of the light.

BATMAN
The police have got it wrong.
They're looking for one product.
It's much bigger than that. The
Joker's tainted hundreds of basic
chemicals at the source.

VICKI
But... then whole shipments of
every product would be poisoned?
We'd all be dead.

BATMAN
No. Each product only contains
one component. The poison only
works when they're mixed. Hair
spray won't do it alone. But...
hair spray and perfume and lipstick
will be toxic and -- Untraceable.

VICKI
(impressed)
How did you figure that out?

No answer. Batman steps away.

BATMAN
Take this to the press.

He hands her a thick envelope. She looks it over
cautiously.

VICKI
I may have some trouble with that.
A lot of people think you and the
Joker work together.

BATMAN
Do me a favor. Don't flatter my
enemy. The man's psychotic.

VICKI
Some people say the same about
you.

This is a new idea to Batman. He pauses for a moment.

BATMAN
What people?

VICKI
Well, let's face it, you're not
exactly normal, are you?

BATMAN
It's not a normal world.

Vicki stares at him. She's suddenly chilled.

VICKI
(peering into the
darkness)
Why did you bring ME here?

BATMAN (O.S.)
(A BEAT; then from
another direction)
People need that information.

VICKI
But you could have just sent it.

She looks around. Where is he? NO SOUND.

Suddenly he is near. She backs up.

BATMAN
You're right, I could have. There
is something else.

She looks down. She has backed up nearly to the gaping
hole.

VICKI
Wh-at?

BATMAN
You have something I want.

Batman suddenly steps very close to her. She holds her
hand to her breast.

VICKI
What could I have that you want?

Batman SWIRLS his cape up over her.

Her eyes widen. She starts to SCREAM.

He embraces her. She stops.

And as she closes her eyes -- he produces an AMPULE of
KNOCKOUT GAS which he breaks under her nose. She slumps.

THE ROOM SPINS. SOUND OF BATS WINGS.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Vicki AWAKENS. She feels her face. Was it a dream?

She steps shakily to the mirror. Touches her lips. What
happened? Did he -- make love to her? Then she touches
her breast. NO FILM.

VICKI
The film! He took the FILM!

PHONE RINGS.

VICKI
Hell-hello?

KNOX
Vicki? Are you all right? You
want me to come over there?

VICKI
(seeing something on
her table)
No... Wait. Allie?

She reaches OUT OF FRAME and brings the envelope Batman
gave her up to the phone.

VICKI
Allie, can you still make the
evening edition if I bring
something to you?

KNOX
Just barely. Is it hot?

VICKI
Yeah it's hot.

KNOX
How hot?

She hangs up.

VICKI
Very hot.

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

The early edition of the Globe carries the banner
headline:

WAR OF THE FREAKS
JOKER AND BATMAN CLASH AT FLUGELHEIM

A DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past, dumping a bundle of AFTER-
NOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk. "WAR OF THE FREAKS" has
been relegated to the lower right-hand corner of the page
-- supplanted by more pressing news.

BATMAN CRACKS JOKER'S POISON CODE
Citizens told to avoid the following products:

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

The "ACTION NEWS" set, with anchor PETER McELROY.

PETER
Avoid the following combinations:
deodorants with baby-powder, hair
spray, and Odor-eaters. Safe
products are flying in as Gotham
City goes on a forced fast. And
all of Gotham is wondering what
to make of Batman. Friend or Foe?

INT. AXIS CHEMICALS - EVENING

Joker SCREAMS at the top of his lungs.

JOKER
I have given a name to my pain and
it is BAT MAN!!!

Joker BLASTS the TV with a riot GUN! OTHER GOONS stare.
Joker charges for the factory.

JOKER
Bob, you got to possess strength
to inflict greater pain! We got
a Bat to kill. And I want to
clean my claws!!

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Bruce looks at assortment of maps. He looks tired.
Alfred brings in some coffee.

ALFRED
(starting to EXIT)
Sir, Miss Vale called again. I
don't know what you intend to do
about her. But I think your
present course of action may just
strengthen her resolve. She's
quite tenacious.

BRUCE
(thinking)
I know, Alfred.

Alfred heads for the door. He stops and pulls himself
tall.

INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

A KNOCK at the door -- Vicki opens it and Bruce is
standing there smiling, a flower in his hand, a shoulder
bag on his shoulder, Vicki is very surprised. She
recovers. Still cool.

VICKI
Well, if it isn't the invisible
man.

BRUCE
You saw through me.

Hands her the flower. She looks at it warmly.

VICKI
Come in.

Bruce ENTERS. She looks at flower like it could squirt
something on her. Bruce smiles. A BEAT of nervous
silence.

BRUCE
So...

VICKI
(hesitates, then)
Listen, I know that we're supposed
to ease into this sort of thing,
but I'm really perplexed about
you.

BRUCE
Yeah, I know, that's why I came.
I...

VICKI
You lied to me about leaving town.
You won't return my phone calls.
Then I saw you march through
bullets like you were trying to
commit suicide.

BRUCE
Look, I... I did kind of lose it
for a while. But some things just
affect me.

VICKI
Affect you? You were a totally
different person.

BRUCE
You have to understand... crime.
I... love this city.

VICKI
See, now he's back... the sweet,
caring guy... but you seem to be
at least two people. What's going
on?

Bruce stands and looks out the window. Torn.

BRUCE
Look, Vicki. There's something
you should know...

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR interrupts him. Vicki lingers and
then goes to the door.

Peering through the peephole, she sees a DELIVERY BOY.

VICKI
Who's there?

DELIVERY BOY
Package for Miss Vale.

DELIVERY BOY hands package in, she signs and shuts door.
Vicki examines the mysterious package. It's another
brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.

VICKI
Bruce, I'm frightened.

Bruce looks at the parcel. Grabbing his shoulder bag, he
takes package to the kitchen.

BRUCE
Shut the door. Just in case.

VICKI
Be careful. Don't set it off.

She shuts the door. Leaving Bruce alone in kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Bruce opens his bag and lifts out a false bottom to
reveal his UTILITY BELT. He removes a tiny ULTRASOUND
SCANNER from the UTILITY BELT -- rather like a stetho-
scope, with a sonar display where the earpieces should be
-- and runs it over the package.

VICKI (O.S.)
What do you think?

BRUCE
Nothing ticking.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vicki moves next to the door and listens.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Bruce takes a small gas mask from his belt, puts it on,
then SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife. Nothing
happens.

VICKI (O.S.)
What's happening? Are you okay?

She KNOCKS. He JUMPS. He's tense. Bruce carefully
pulls back the flaps. SUDDENLY the top of the package
BURSTS OPEN.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vicki JUMPS at the NOISE.

VICKI
Bruce, are you all right?

No answer.

VICKI
Bruce, I'm coming in.

She grabs for the door and PUSHES THROUGH.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Bruce stares at the package. No utility belt in sight.

BRUCE
Very poetic.

ON BOX

-- A GLOVED HAND on a SPRING, holding a BUNCH OF DEAD
FLOWERS, has erupted through the top of the package and
wobbles about. There is a large EMBOSSED CARD in the
flowers. Bruce lifts out the card and she reads it.

VICKI
'Roses are red, violets are blue,
these flowers are dead, you could
be, too.'
(suddenly very
frightened)
He sent something just before he
arrived the last time.

Bruce nods her out of there. Vicki heads for the living
room, but before she can get through the kitchen door,
the Joker, BOB and ONE OTHER GOON BURST THROUGH THE DOOR.

JOKER
Miss me?

The Joker sees Bruce and stops in his tracks.

JOKER
Well, Ms. Vale, another rooster
in the henhouse?

The Joker pulls a gun and moves toward Bruce. He traces
the outline of Bruce's cheek with the gun.

JOKER
Tell me something, my friend, you
ever danced with the devil by the
pale moonlight?

Bruce is alarmed. A memory fragment clicks.

BRUCE
What?

JOKER
I ask that question of all my prey
before I send a draft through
their domes. I just like the sound
of it.

BOB CHUCKLES. Bruce is torn, should he fight? Should he
reveal his identity? Suddenly he realizes... his utility
belt is sitting in plain view on the kitchen counter!!!
The Joker has yet to notice. Bruce backs slowly against
the counter, shielding the belt from view.

JOKER
Vicki, don't let my happy-go-lucky
appearance fool you. I'm really
very upset.
(getting angrier)
You were dining with me! Talking
art, I was a man who was getting
somewhere with a beautiful woman.
And then ALL OF A SUDDEN, without
a word of apology, you take off
with that SIDESHOW PHONY.

He moves closer to her.

JOKER
(bizarrely sincere
bad poetry)
I'm only laughing on the outside,
my smile is skin deep, if you
could see inside I'm really crying
you might join me for a weep.

He cups his hand under Vicki's chin. Bruce CHARGES at
him.

A BACKHAND from a GOON knocks Bruce off his feet. As he
reels backward, he contrives to knock the UTILITY BELT
off the counter, by sweeping his ARM across it.

Bruce sprawls in a heap in the corner.

IN A FLASH -- Joker points his gun at Bruce and pulls the
trigger. A tiny flag -- "BANG!" -- pops out of the
muzzle, prompting GREAT HILARITY all around. Joker
HOWLS! Bruce sweats.

JOKER
Came on I want you to shoot some
snaps. Make me immortal. It'll
be good for you.

BOB hands Vicki her camera and bag and jacket.

A SCREAM FROM OUT IN THE STREET BELOW calls her to the
window.

EXT. STREET BELOW - HER POV - DAY

A police car has run up on the sidewalk. TWO POLICEMEN
are staggering in the street, grabbing their throats.
A WOMAN runs horrified from the scene..

INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DAY

She turns back to the Joker.

VICKI
What's wrong with those policemen?

JOKER
Looks like they're rethinking
their spot in the social order.

BOB pulls Vicki OUT THE DOOR, Joker FOLLOWS, pulls the
door to.

ON BRUCE

He leaps up and stuffs the utility belt into shoulder
bag.

SUDDENLY THE JOKER IS THERE

JOKER
Listen, Bruce, NEVER rub another
man's rhubarb! Get me?

The Joker levels the GUN at Bruce again and FIRES. This
time a real bullet. Bruce is thrown back against the
wall as the bullet hits him.

Joker EXITS.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY

Goons force Vicki into a van. Joker heads for it, too.

JOKER
Gotham Square, lickety split.

INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Bruce is coming around. He checks his side, no blood.
He then looks at his shoulder bag, it has a hole in it.
He takes out the utility belt. It has a bullet embedded
in it.

Bruce struggles up, straps on the UTILITY BELT, dials a
number on its digital pad. Red lights scan and then
beep. Bruce RUNS INTO THE BEDROOM.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

He rummages around for something in her closet. Finds a
black something and EXITS.

EXT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER

Bruce sprints across the hallway and up a stairway.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY (MOMENT LATER)

Bruce bursts onto the roof just in time to see VAN pull
out into the traffic.

He pulls the black nylon ski cap over his head -- and
BOUNDS OFF across the rooftops.

EXT. CROSS STREET - DAY (MOMENT LATER)

The VAN passes by. PEDESTRIANS staring goggle-eyed at
the rooftops.

Far above them, a MAN -- oddly garbed in a suit, a tie,
a yellow belt and a BLACK SKI MASK -- is gliding across
the intersection on a ROPE.

INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

The Joker is being thrown around a bit by the speeding,
swerving van. Suddenly he reaches forward and grabs BOB.

JOKER
(violently)
Slow down, you maniac!

The Joker turns to Vicki, putting his hand on her knee.
She tries to move away from him.

JOKER
(sadly, trying to
gain her sympathy)
I'm a little high-strung. Y'know,
I've recently had tragedy in my
life. Day before yesterday,
Alicia hurled herself out of the
window. Couldn't adjust to my new
aesthetic.

He hands her a porcelain mask. It has a crack in it.

JOKER
But you can't make an omelette
without breakin' some eggs!

EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY (THAT MOMENT)

The Joker's VAN GUNS through a red light, just missing a
MOUNTED POLICEMAN standing by his horse. His horse
shies, rears back, turns in a circle. THE POLICEMAN,
already in bad shape, struggles with his throat, moving
slow as molasses. His face contorts into a smile and he
shakes his head slowly.

Bruce lands on horse's back. COP turns slowly around,
sees Bruce. Bruce looks with alarm at the policeman.

HIS POV - ANOTHER POLICEMAN

staggers down the street, his hands grasping his throat.
Joker has done his evil work.

EXT. SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Bruce on horseback, charging past elegant brownstones,
drawing stares from PASSERSBY. On his belt is a FLASHING
RED SIGNAL LIGHT.

EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT

A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.

INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT

We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat
beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of
the city -- and on it a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in
perfect sync with the one on Bruce's belt.

EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

Bruce sees the VW bug rounding the corner and streaking
towards him. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its
hind legs; the BUG pulls up.

-- and Alfred hands Bruce a bundle of Batclothes.

BRUCE
Alfred, find the records on my
family. I want to check something.

ALFRED
Yes, sir. Be careful.

Bruce, now nearly fully dressed as Batman, gets back on
the horse and RIDES OFF. Alfred looks pained.

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE (GOTHAM CITY) - DAY

The square where the unveiling is taking place, has been
closed to traffic. There are barricades at the entrance
streets.

A temporary stage has been erected around a shrouded
statue on one side of the square. A SMALL CROWD is
gathered.

OFF TO ONE SIDE - POLICEMAN

crouches in the grass. TWO PEOPLE try to help him.

CLOSER ON POLICEMAN

He struggles to move his head to look up. WE SEE: his
face is contorting into a smile.

BACK AT STAGE

A Junior high school BAND is playing the "Happy Birthday"
theme.

MAYOR
(gushing)
Happy birthday, Gotham City! You
know every city has a father and
no one could have been a better
father than John T. Gotham.

The van ENTERS the square and stops. Joker, flanked by
armed GOONS, gets out, Vicki is pulled along with him.

Joker pushes through the crowd at the bottom of the steps
leading up to the stage.

MAYOR
I dedicate the statue of a man
who embodies the past, present,
and future of our great city.

Mayor pulls a cord and drops the shroud around the statue
revealing: Not John T. Gotham. But:

A GARISH, POLYCHROME STATUE OF THE JOKER wielding two Uzi
machine guns like they were six-shooters. Expressionism
on acid.

JOKER
(excited)
Start shootin', my sweet. I'm
makin' history.

Joker clambers onto the stage.

JOKER
(apologetically)
No autographs.

He seizes the mike from terrified Mayor. The Joker holds
a small machine gun on him. Under the grin, he's
grinning.

MAYOR
Call the police!

JOKER
What police?

ANGLE ON SEVERAL POLICEMEN

lying on grass.

JOKER
(supremely
confident)
Hi there, fellow Gothamites! As
the NEXT founding father of this
fair city, I declare these
celebrations well and truly open.

He FIRES A BURST into the air, knocking down one corner
of the ANNIVERSARY BANNER. Joker LAUGHS MANIACALLY.

Suddenly, from nowhere, a BAT BOLO ZINGS through the air.
Its heavy ends wrap symmetrically around the head of the
statue. A HISSING RISES from the bomb-like bolo ends.

Vicki looks up as PEOPLE RUSH away from the stage, PEOPLE
are SCREAMING.

BATMAN - ON TOP BUILDING

FIRING the BOLOS from a crossbow sort of weapon.

Suddenly a BLAST as both ends of the bob EXPLODE and
knock the head of the statue off. Joker is stunned.

JOKER
My very face destroyed!

TWO GOONS FIRE AT BATMAN.

ON BATMAN

He FIRES two lines into the ground and SWINGS down be-
tween them to the stage. BULLETS FLY AROUND HIM. TWO
GOONS attack him and he kicks them both down and heads
for Joker.

Joker grabs the Mayor around the neck. Covers him with
gun.

JOKER
DAMN! I got a good one for you,
Batman. What's red and bloody and
has no brains?

Batman circles Joker.

JOKER
I didn't know Bats came out in the
daytime.

BATMAN
Just when murderous clowns leave
the circus. Let him go.

JOKER
Aw, can't I keep him? I'll feed
him.

BATMAN
What do you want from this city?

JOKER
(thinking aloud)
I want a new bicycle, I want to
visit Florida, I want...

ON VICKI

holding up her camera.

VICKI
Let me get this, Joker.

He turns to her and poses. She FLASHES.

Batman takes this occasion to SNAP his finger.

BATMAN
Joker!

Joker looks at him. Batman materializes a Joker card.
Joker looks at it and Batman sucker PUNCHES him in the
face as the Mayor rolls away.

Joker rolls backward and zips to his feet. He looks
around as GOONS FLEE.

JOKER
The odds are even. So I'm a
leavin'. You got your toys --
I got mine.

Joker steps back onto the statue platform and AMIDST
COLORED SMOKE AND FIREWORKS he DISAPPEARS DOWN into the
sewer system.

Batman spins around. The goons SPEED AWAY in the van.
Vicki readies her camera to snap Batman.

BATMAN
Thanks.

VICKI
So we're even. I don't owe you
anything.

BATMAN
Whatever you say.

Vicki snaps a photo. Batman looks at her for a beat, a
hint of disappointment. POLICE SIRENS. Batman FIRES a
line up to the building and ZOOMS UP the line to the top.
He disappears as Vicki shoots pix.

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE MORGUE ROOM - DAY

Knox is beside himself. Vicki is thoughtful.

KNOX
... And you didn't have film in
your camera?

VICKI
This goon handed it to me. I
didn't check. Oh, Allie, I'm
really losing it.

KNOX
I found out about your strange
street corner.

She looks up at him.

KNOX
Your friend Bruce is pretty screwed
up, Vicki.

VICKI
More good news?

He motions her to a microfilm reader. Knox begins
cranking through back-issue newspapers.

KNOX
Okay, here we go. Check it out.

Vicki stares at the screen. A BANNER HEADLINE reads:

THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED
Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed

Beneath it, a PHOTO: Cops kneeling over corpses. Medics
with stretchers. And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY --
BRUCE WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a
BEAT COP.

BOY stares at the camera -- a mask of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY.

KNOX
Some snap, huh?

VICKI
(true horror)
Oh my God... his parents were
murdered in that alley. That's
why he went there. It was the
anniversary of their death.

TIGHT ON YOUNG BRUCE'S FACE

His features recognizable across all the years --
permanently, indelibly traumatized.

BACK TO SCENE

KNOX
Yep. Poor kid watched the whole
thing happen.

VICKI
(deep empathy)
Allie, the look on his face...
it's just like that day with the
Joker in front of City Hall.

KNOX
Can you imagine what this could
do to a guy, Vicki?

TIGHT ON VICKI

She thinks about that.

BACK TO SCENE

VICKI
(after a BEAT)
Allie, does it say... how old his
father was -- when he was killed?

KNOX
Yeah, I noticed that, young guy,
too... just turned 35 years old.

TIGHT ON VICKI

She makes a connection.

VICKI
(knows now but
hides it)
I've got to go.

BACK TO SCENE

Vicki EXITS slowly.

KNOX
Don't let your personal feelings
interfere with your job.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. Thirty
screens show Wayne Manor's empty rooms.

Bruce is slumped at a table, he's sleeping, head resting
on A MAP OF GOTHAM. Alfred TIPTOES IN and folds batcape.
Bruce wakes.

BRUCE
The file on my parents?

Alfred nods toward it. He's grave.

BRUCE
What's on your mind, Alfred?

ALFRED
I'm getting old, Sir. And I don't
want to fill my days grieving for
old friends. Or their sons.

EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

The steps are packed with TV NEWS CREWS. The MAYOR,
flanked by JIM GORDON and HARVEY DENT, steps gloomily to
a podium.

MAYOR
The 200th Anniversary Birthday
Gala has been indefinitely
postponed.

EXT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY

TECHNICIANS in VIDEO TRUCKS, watching on remote monitors.

DENT (V.O.)
We're vehemently opposed to
terrorism in any form. But a
toxin has been found in the coffee
at the police station. With two-
thirds of our police force
disabled we simply can't guarantee
public safety --

INSERT - TELEVISION MONITOR - THAT MOMENT

VIDEO NOISE wipes half the image away, leaving a SPLIT
SCREEN. On one side is the MAYOR. On the other --
sitting in a director's chair with a big yellow HAPPY
FACE behind him -- is THE JOKER. But a very DIFFERENT
Joker indeed. Relaxed and very lucid. With his flesh-
colored makeup on he manages to make his grin almost
friendly.

JOKER
Joker here.
(standing up)
Now you guys have said some pretty
mean things. Some of which I
admit were true under that fiend
Boss Grissom. He was a terrorist
and a thief. But on the other
hand he was great at Bridge.
Anyway he's dead and he left me in
charge. Now I CAN be theatrical,
maybe even a bit rough -- but
there's one thing I'm not. I'm
NOT a killer. I'm an artist.
(big grin)
And I looove a party. So truce.
COMMENCE AU FESTIVAL!

He spreads his arms to a torrent of CANNED APPLAUSE.

JOKER
I even got a little present for
Gotham City. At midnight I drop
20 million dollars cash on the
crowd. I've got plenty so don't
worry about me.

MAYOR
We are not prepared to discuss
any deals...

JOKER
(interrupting)
You heard me, folks -- $20 million!

SERIES OF IMAGES OF CITIZENS

Ears prick up. They are very interested.

JOKER
And there will be entertainment.
The BIG FIGHT. Me in one corner,
and in the other, the man who has
brought the real terror to this
city. BATMAN.

ON MAYOR AND DENT

They look at each other in surprise.

JOKER
(leaning in to CAMERA;
to Batman)
Can you hear me! Just you and me.
Mano A Mano. I've taken off my
makeup, let's see if you can take
off yours.

INT. WAYNE STUDY - EVENING

Bruce stares at TV. Shuts it OFF. He takes deep regular
breaths.

CLOSER ANGLE

He pulls out a police file.

ON SOUND TRACK

-- A MEMORY SOUNDS FROM THE PAST float by -- A SNATCH OF
MUSIC. A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER.

ON FILE

Bruce opens a file "POLICE REPORT. UNSOLVED" is written
across the cover.

He turns the page and the POLICE PHOTOS FALL OUT. He
picks one up.

A WASH OF MEMORY SOUND floods the screen. STREET NOISES.
A LITTLE BOY'S VOICE.

ON PHOTO

The shocked-sad face of the little boy that terrible night.

MEMORY SOUND WASHES LOUDER. QUICKER FOOTSTEPS. A VOICE.

BRUCE'S MOTHER (V.O.)
Tom, there's someone following us!

CUT TO:

BRUCE'S MEMORY - EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT (1963)

THOMAS, MARTHA and the young BRUCE WAYNE are running
TOWARDS us. Something stops them.

CUT TO:

BRUCE'S POV

We see TWO YOUNG HOODLUMS pointing a gun AT us. The
HOODLUM with the gun grabs the string of pearls on
Martha's neck. Thomas tries to grab the young HOOD's
arm. We hear the SOUND OF A SHOT. Thomas falls. Martha
SCREAMS. The HOOD FIRES -- Martha falls. The second
HOODLUM runs away.

The HOODLUM points the gun AT the CAMERA. The HOODLUM'S
FACE IS IN THE DARK.

CUT TO:

YOUNG BRUCE

staring back.

JACK (V.O.)
(distorted by time)
Tell me, Kid...

The Hood steps into the moonlight. It is clearly a young
Jack Napier.

YOUNG JACK NAPIER
You ever danced with the devil
by the pale moonlight?

ON TRIGGER FINGER

-- It squeezes. Suddenly a VOICE calls out.

OTHER HOOD (V.O.)
C'mon... let's go.

CUT BACK TO:

YOUNG BRUCE'S POV

Where we see Jack begin to move slowly away. He LAUGHS
as HE LEAVES.

INT. STUDY - EVENING

CLOSE ON Bruce's tortured face -- his eyes snap open.
He is breathing heavily and pouring with sweat.

BRUCE
It was him.

VICKI (O.S.)
Are you alright?

Bruce starts. He turns to see Vicki standing there.
Alfred is near the door, having let her in.

BRUCE
Wh... how did you get in here?

Alfred EXITS. Vicki pours herself a drink. She's a
little nervous.

VICKI
Alfred. Am I crazy? That wasn't
just another 'night' for either of
us. Was it? We got to each other.
Didn't we?

Bruce gathers himself and shuts the police folders.

VICKI
You were going to tell me
something at my apartment... when
the Joker came? What was it?

Bruce looks away.

VICKI
Why won't you let me in?

He looks straight into her heart.

BRUCE
You got in.

Vicki looks startled. My God... he loves her. The
dilemma fills in the space between them.

VICKI
I don't know how to think about
all this.

BRUCE
You said you got to a place where
you just had to live with the way
you were. Well that's this place.

VICKI
I loved you every night since
I met you. But I don't know if I
can love you dead.

BRUCE
I can't help you out with that.
I've been trying to avoid this.
But that's the way it is. I wear
a cape. You take pictures. It's
not a perfect world.

VICKI
It doesn't have to be a perfect
world. I've just got to know if
we're gonna try to love each
other.

Bruce stops and looks at her. Vicki at him. He can't
commit.

BRUCE
He's out there tonight, and now I
gotta go to work.

Bruce DISAPPEARS into the dark.

SERIES OF SHOTS

THEME MUSIC UP.

Bruce prepares for a final confrontation with the Joker.

The gloves. The boots. The cape. And finally, the
black bat-emblem, framed in yellow, FILLING the SCREEN.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - NIGHT

A big yellow moon. The wheels of a truck.

TILT UP TO -- sign AXIS CHEMICAL WORKS. Huge steel gates
CLOSE.

Opposite the gate, the headlights of the BATMOBILE come on.
Its ENGINES ROAR, shooting clouds from multiple exhausts.
Front fender extends as vehicle ROARS down the street.

GOON GUARD jumps for his life as the BATMOBILE, head-
lights blazing, SMASHES through gates, coming to rest in
front of the steel doors of main building.

GATE GUARD
It's Batman!

Flaps on the wings of the BATMOBILE open as the GATE
GUARD FIRES his pistol at the car.

Rocket launchers emerge through the open flaps. Guard's
bullets BOUNCE off BATMOBILE's bodywork.

The ROCKETS IGNITE AND BLAST OFF to demolish the
shuttered steel doors. Gate guard RUNS OFF.

The rocket launchers retract. BATMOBILE moves through
hole in doors.

INT. AXIS CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

Goons inside take cover as BATMOBILE cruises through
the shattered doors and stops. They OPEN FIRE with
MACHINE GUNS. One or two of the bullets CRASH through
the WINDSHIELD.

EXT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

Batmobile slowly shields itself. Hunkering down like an
iron butterfly.

ON GOONS

They peer at it. FIRE WILDLY to no effect.

ON BATMOBILE WHEELS

From the hubcaps come arms. Each holding a wicked
looking cache of plastic explosives. GOONS don't SEE IT.

INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

From within the cockpit we see: under the facia, a
monitor, flashing a countdown. 12.11.10. We ZOOM INTO
the monitor as the numbers flick from 10 to 9.

CUT TO:

INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

The MONITOR beneath the facia of the BATMOBILE as it
reads DETONATE.

CUT TO:

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

The Axis Chemical PLANT EXPLODES like a ball of fire.

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - ANOTHER ANGLE

Debris and dust fall to earth. The building is devas-
tated. Flattened. Nothing could have lived through the
blast. A BEAT. SILENCE. Suddenly from within the
burned rubble -- A RUMBLE.

CLOSER - ON DEBRIS

Something stirs, lifts, moves up and then out, slowly,
the Batmobile pulls itself out of the debris.

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - NIGHT

BATMOBILE drives up to the gate. From out of the dark-
ness Batman steps and pats it on the fender. It CHUGS.

SOUND OF CHOPPER -- bright search lights flash on Batman.
BULLETS FLY all around him. He jumps behind steel gate.

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - WIDER

A CHOPPER ROARS up from behind a building. LOUDSPEAKER
BLASTS.

JOKER (V.O.)
Not even close! NO CIGAR, fool!

ANOTHER ANGLE - CLOSE ON JOKER

from the open side door of a chopper. He's delighted.

JOKER
I'm going to the festival. You
really ought to show up. I'm
gonna kill a thousand people an
hour until you do.

LAUGHTER as the chopper banks sharply and FLIES OFF
over the river toward the searchlights of the festival.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

A lone WATCHMAN reads in a chair. The LIGHTS WINK OUT.

-- and a THUG clubs him from behind. A SMALL ARMY OF
CRIMINAL SHOCK TROOPS ENTERS. Lights relight.

SEARCHLIGHTS, mounted on trucks with portable generators.
Behind the trucks: gaudy PARADE FLOATS -- and enormous
deflated BALLOONS, hanging limply from rafters.

Joker's men inflate BALLOONS. STEEL DOORS rise; the
BEACON TRUCKS RUMBLE out onto the street. Joker STEPS
INTO the warehouse.

JOKER
I'm prepared to rule the world!!

EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM (BROAD AVENUE) - THAT MOMENT

The main street, Broad Avenue, leading into the central
square. Groups of CAUTIOUS PEDESTRIANS. AMPLIFIED ROCK
MUSIC as a truck with searchlights rounds a corner onto
Broad Avenue.

Searchlights play up the street and onto the buildings.
A beam illuminates A GIGANTIC BALLOON WITH A HUGE
CARTOON FACE looking round the corner before entering
the Avenue.

This balloon is moored to a parade float. More trucks
with searchlights, floats and giant balloons FOLLOW.
Cartoon characters and historical figures. Banners
proclaim; HAPPY BIRTHDAY GOTHAM CITY.

BYSTANDERS are amazed.

Suddenly THE AIR IS FILLED with thousands of dollar
bills.

From the face of the leading balloon (a huge, grotesque,
clown smiling ghoulishly and dressed in white Pierrot
frills) we TILT DOWN THROUGH the swirling dollars.

Here, on a float, surrounded by armed GOONS, sitting on
a giant throne, is the Joker.

Bob hands the Joker bundles of dollar bills. Joker
pitches the bills, with a grand gesture, up into the
wind from a giant fan. People grab for the greenbacks
as they fill the air.

TIGHT ON BILL

A REAL one-dollar bill.

WIDER

Like a demonic D.J. the Joker is LIP-SYNCHING TO WHAT-
EVER SONG is BLARING OUT over the SPEAKERS.

PEOPLE flock in from the side streets. Soon the whole
area is packed with CITIZENS scrambling for dollar bills.

EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

Vicki's taking photographs of the hysterical CITIZENS.

JOKER (V.O.)
(amplified)
Welcome, everyone. Enjoy yourselves.
Open those hungry wallets!

He LAUGHS.

A HORN BLARES. Vicki glances nervously around and is
relieved to see Knox lean out of his car.

KNOX
Vicki!

VICKI scrambles into the car.

INT. KNOX'S CAR - SIDE STREET - MOMENT LATER

KNOX
You think Batman will show for
this?

He'll be here.

EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

Knox DRIVES OFF to join the parade.

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT

The city on its island, DARK except for the search-lights
lining Broad Avenue.

All at once, a STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME...
THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift and
sleek, it slices through the night, carrying its pilot on
a final mission of mercy -- and vengeance.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

In the cockpit, Batman, his jaw set, shifts the joystick
and banks the BATWING.

EXT. AERIAL SHOT - BATWING OVER GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

The BATWING banks away FROM the CAMERA and dives towards
the blacked-out city.

CUT TO:

crowds of PEOPLE still chasing them, fighting and
looting.

We see Knox' s car join the back of the parade.

INT. KNOX'S CAR - THAT MOMENT

Vicki is taking pictures of everything in sight. But
she's clearly looking for Batman.

KNOX
(looking up ahead)
Look at that!

VICKI
(snapping away)
Pull over.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - KNOX AND VICKI'S POV - THAT MOMENT

Where we see that one of the floats has mounted the side-
walk, crashed into a lamp standard and come to a halt.
The Goons on board are fighting off the crowds of people
who are chasing the dollar bills which have lodged on the
float.

CUT TO:

INT. KNOX'S CAR - THAT MOMENT

Knox pulls over to the side of the Avenue while Vicki
continues taking pictures.

KNOX
Man, this is sick!

Vicki opens the car door and begins to climb out to get
better shots.

KNOX
A girl could get hurt in a place
like this.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

Vicki leans against Knox's car and looks up to see a
giant balloon of a grotesque UNDERDOG bouncing against
the side of a building. (This is the balloon which is
attached to the crashed float.)

Vicki whips out her telephoto lens, and is adjusting the
zoom when she does a double take, looks through the lens
again -- and sees.

CUT TO:

VICKI'S POV OF UNDERDOG THROUGH LONG LENS - THAT
MOMENT

WE SEE, fixed to the underside of the balloon, a number
of metal cylinders. One of them, damaged by hitting the
side of the building, is beginning TO LEAK A VILE-LOOKING
GREEN GAS. The heavy gas drops groundward.

CUT TO:

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - CRASHED FLOAT - THAT MOMENT

GOONS also spot leak and don gas masks. The green gas
arrives at street level.

Two unfortunate CITIZENS begin to choke, their faces
paralyzed into rictus grins. One of them appears to drop
dead.

Forty yards away, Vicki panics.

VICKI
Those balloons are full of Smylex
gas! He's going to kill everybody!

Knox tries to drag Vicki back into the car.

KNOX
Get in! Close the door.

At that moment we hear, through the parade music, the
SOUND OF THE BATWING overhead. Vicki looks up.

CUT TO:

VICKI'S POV OF BATWING - THAT MOMENT

The BATWING, lower than before, swoops between the
skyscrapers.

CLOSE SHOT OF BATWING COCKPIT - THAT MOMENT

Batman, at the controls, looks at Broad Avenue below.

VICKI
We've got to cut those balloons
loose. I think I saw Batman.
We've got to warn him.

Knox drags Vicki into car and SLAMS the door.

INT. KNOX'S CAR (BROAD AVENUE) - THAT MOMENT

Knox thinks for a moment before coming to a decision.

KNOX
Don't move.

He JUMPS OUT.

VICKI
(trying to stop him)
Allie...

He runs round to the trunk, opens it and returns with a
tool box. He takes out a pair of metal cutters and a
cheap anti-dust mask.

VICKI
What are you doing?

KNOX
Stay here! Let me do this one
thing.

VICKI
Allie, please... be careful.

Knox puts on the mask. With the metal cutters in his
hand, he races towards the crashed float.

EXT. CRASHED FLOAT (BROAD AVENUE) - MOMENTS LATER

Nobody is paying attention to the few people affected by
the gas. Knox LEAPS ONTO the crashed float. Before the
Goons have even noticed that he's there, he's cut through
one of UNDERDOG's moorings.

ANGLE ON UNDERDOG

As one, now free, corner of the balloon floats up between
buildings.

A Goon FIRES at Knox. Knox ducks, but then is hit.

Knox's CAR SCREECHES UP. Vicki flings open the door,
grabs Knox by the collar, and DRIVES AWAY, dragging Knox
with her.

The Goons SHOOT after them. Holes appear in Knox's car
and most of the WINDOWS are SHOT OUT, but the car makes
it round a corner and off Broad Avenue before the ENGINE
CUTS OUT.

Vicki drags Knox into a SHELTERED DOORWAY next to Gotham
Cathedral.

Blood flows down Knox's face from a minor head wound. He
looks at her.

VICKI
You were great, Allie. Don't try
any more heroics tonight.

Knox goes unconscious.

The Batwing approaches over tops of the skyscrapers.

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

The Joker still graciously dispensing dollar bills.

JOKER
That's right, folks. Who can you
trust? Me, I'm here handing out
real money. And where is Batman?
He's at home washing his tights!

LAUGHING. Suddenly he hears the BATWING, looks up. He
waves and leaps up and down with excitement.

The Joker LAUGHS CRAZILY.

A hand rubs the green dye off and we see underneath.
JOKER MONEY, with JOKER'S FACE on the one-dollar bill.

BACK TO SCENE

CROWD
(CHORUS OF ANGER)
This stuff is fake!

The Joker LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY.

JOKER
(through microphone)
Now comes part where I relieve you,
the little people, of the burden
of your failed and useless lives.
But as my plastic surgeon always
said, when you got to go, go with
a SMILE!

Joker takes a remote control device from under his

trigger.

in response to the Joker's switch. The balloon swells.

LASER, all BLASTING away.

ANGLE ON JOKER - THAT MOMENT

The Joker sneers and starts to draw a gun from his belt.
But he goes on drawing it. On and on. Finally, he bran-
dishes the entire weapon. It's a very long barrel.

The Joker takes aim. The GUN GOES OFF WITH A GREAT
EXPLOSION and a tongue of flame. The recoil throws the
Joker backwards.

INT. BATWING COCKPIT - MOMENT LATER

The cockpit begins to fill with smoke, blinding Batman.
The ENGINES COUGH AND CUT OUT.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

Vicki sees the Batwing's in trouble. She runs after it.

INT. BATWING COCKPIT - THAT MOMENT

Everything is vibrating, the joystick comes loose in
Batman's hands. Smoke fills the cockpit.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

The Joker, clutching his smoking pistol, ducks down as
the stricken Batwing careens over his head. He dances a
victory jig.

ANGLE ON BATWING - THAT MOMENT

The Batwing belly-flops onto the street and bounces,
spewing black smoke and debris.

It bounces again and begins to cartwheel.

INT. BATWING COCKPIT - THAT MOMENT

Batman blows the perspex canopy off the cockpit, releas-
ing some of the smoke. Flames shoot from the control
panel.

The Batwing rolls over, throwing Batman around.

BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT

The Cathedral spins as the Batwing hurtles towards it.

EXT. CATHEDRAL STEPS - MOMENT LATER

BATWING SMASHES into Cathedral steps and stops. COMPLETE
SILENCE. Then Joker's LAUGH ECHOES down Broad Avenue.

ANGLE ON JOKER - THAT MOMENT

Joker's doubled up with laughter. Tears down his cheeks.

But forming around him is AN ANGRY CROWD. He looks up
at it and LAUGHS even harder.

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

Batman, dazed and hurt, is trying, with difficulty, to
free himself from the smouldering, twisted wreckage of
the cockpit.

ANGLE ON JOKER AND CROWD - THAT MOMENT

The crowd is pressing in on Joker. Gordon ARRIVES with
SMALL POLICE FORCE. Joker pulls out another GUN and
FIRES in the air. He backs off quickly down the street.

EXT. CATHEDRAL STEPS - MOMENT LATER

Joker ARRIVES to see wreckage. No movement inside.
Suddenly the BATWING EXPLODES. Knocking Joker head over
heels.

Joker stands up, looking at burning wreckage and sees
distant crowd coming toward him.

EXT. CATHEDRAL STEPS - MOMENT LATER

The Joker scurries up to the top of the steps.

EXT. TOP OF CATHEDRAL STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

The Joker takes a walkie-talkie from his pocket.

JOKER
Gotham Cathedral tower. It's
getting crowded down here. Come
and get me in five minutes.

VOICE (V.O.)
(over radio)
Roger, boss.

He looks up towards the absurdly high tower.

JOKER
Better make it ten.

The Joker ENTERS the Cathedral.

EXT. BATWING WRECKAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Vicki comes upon wreckage. Suddenly Batman lifts up from
the smoking metal. He's shaken and his cape is torn and
caught.

VICKI
Are you all right?

Batman gathers himself like thunder. Total galvanizsed
focus on the cathedral and Joker inside.

VICKI
I'll get you out of here.

POLICE CARS approaching, SIRENS BLARING.

BATMAN
(pointing to a large
chunk of metal
tethering his cape)
Kick that!

Vicki kicks it. The cape is free. Batman walks by her
like a knight from hell.

INT. CATHEDRAL - MOMENTS LATER

Suddenly -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED
BLACK GHOST.

Batman closes the Cathedral door. He pulls a heavy bar
over the door. He stops and listens. He shuffles for-
ward, falls down a step, and crashes against the rear pew,
knocking it over. The pew falls and all the pews go down
like dominoes, making a LOT OF NOISE.

Before the front pew has fallen, the Joker darts out from
behind it and runs, LAUGHING, into the belltower.

JOKER (O.S.)
Missed me. Hee hee.

Batman sets off in painful pursuit.

INT. BOTTOM OF BELLTOWER STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Batman reaches the bottom of the stairs leading up the
belltower and collapses against the bannisters. Above
him he can hear the Joker's RECEDING FOOTSTEPS on the
CREAKING, rotting STAIRS.

Batman sets his jaw, takes a couple of deep, painful
breaths, and hauls himself up the wooden stairs.

EXT. CATHEDRAL STEPS - THAT MOMENT

COMMISSIONER GORDON with a few POLICEMEN rush to
Cathedral door.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON JOKER - THAT MOMENT

We see the JOKER's feet climbing the stairs, faster and
faster, as he races up the spiral staircase.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

Lower down the stairs we see Batman climbing, slower and
slower -- somehow he keeps going.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON JOKER - MOMENTS
LATER

The Joker, slightly out of breath, comes bounding up
toward the CAMERA, grinning and chuckling, heading for
the belltower itself, where the bells are housed.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

Batman, too, moves up toward the CAMERA, but very slowly.
He looks dreadful. He turns a corner and looks up.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON JOKER - MOMENT LATER

The Joker reaches the top of the stairs and a wooden
ceiling. There is a trapdoor set in the ceiling directly
above the stairs.

The Joker, hearing something from below, leans over the
handrail, looks down the stairwell and listens.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRWELL - JOKER'S POV - THAT MOMENT

We see the staircase spiralling down into the gloom and
hear the sound of COMMISSIONER GORDON and his POLICE
SQUAD as they ENTER the belltower and begin to climb the
stairs.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRWELL - ANGLE ON JOKER - MOMENT LATER

The Joker opens the trapdoor and climbs into the moonlit
belfry.

INT. BELFRY - MOMENTS LATER

Joker EMERGES through the trapdoor into the belfry. Tall
louvred "windows" on each side designed to protect the
bells but let out sound. Openings in each wall lead out
onto a parapet which runs all the way round the tower.

In the middle of the belfry a giant bell sits rusting on
its rocker-beds. Two other, smaller, rocker-beds are
empty. The bells from these are sitting on the floor
beside the trapdoor.

The Joker casually squirts one of the holding pins on the
bell with his acid flower, it begins to burn as he walks
forward and looks at his watch nonchalantly. The BELL
behind him BREAKS, SMASHING down from the tower.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - MOMENTS
LATER

Batman flattens himself against the wall as the bell
plummets past bringing pieces of staircase with it.
Batman nearly falls with the bell.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON GORDON AND POLICE

As the SOUND OF BREAKING STAIRCASE gets CLOSER GORDON and
the POLICE run down the stairs. They are quickly fol-
lowed by the bell and a mass of broken, rotten, dusty
timber.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - MOMENTS
LATER

Batman claws up stairs and collapses just under the
closed trapdoor of the belfry. He tries to open the
trapdoor but doesn't have the strength.

INT. BELFRY - THAT MOMENT

Joker paces, impatiently waiting for his rescue heli-
copter. Glances at his watch.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

Batman, beneath the trapdoor, can hear the Joker pacing.

INT. BELFRY - THAT MOMENT

The Joker, hearing something beneath the trapdoor, begins
to move the second bell over it. However, his curiosity
gets the better of him and he lifts the trap a fraction
of an inch. He opens the trap fully, no Batman.

JOKER
I must have belled the bat!

Joker LAUGHS then stops and looks around slowly.

JOKER
There ain't any more of you up
here, are there? -- Daddy or Momma
bat?

The Joker LAUGHS, CRAZILY.

BATMAN (O.S.)
My parents are dead. But you
remember that, don't you, Jack?

Joker turns quickly to see Batman standing with cape un-
furled. A rappeling line hangs from his belt and out
onto the parapet. A small pulley on the belt. The
Joker CACKLES.

JOKER
You climbed up the outside with
a rope!
(LAUGHTER)
You little monkey! God, look at
you. You're a mess.
(laughs)
They're gonna be real mad at the
costume shop when they see what
you did to their suit.

Batman steps toward him. Joker steps back into the
half-dark.

BATMAN
(wicked smile)
Yeah, and they asked me to bring
your face back to the shop for
some work. Even if I have to tear
it off.

JOKER
You maniac, it was you who dropped
me in the tanks. You made me.

BATMAN
I made you. And you made me.

JOKER
What is this? I say you made me
and you have to say I made you?
How childish can you get? You're
insane.

BATMAN
(the voice of doom)
Are we going to kill each other,
Jack?

JOKER (O.S.)
(slightly nervous)
Jack? Jack's out, I'm running his
body while he's gone.

BATMAN
Well, when you see him -- tell him
I'm gonna kick his ass!

Batman steps in Joker's direction. From out of the dark-
ness Joker swings a huge BELL which SMASHES INTO BATMAN.
He is knocked over backwards out onto the parapet, he
nearly falls over the edge.

BATMAN'S POV OF GROUND ZERO - NIGHT

A frightening view thirty stories down toward death.

EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Batman catches himself just before he topples over.

INT. BELFRY - NIGHT

Joker creeps around alone. Not sure if Batman fell. He
hides, flattened up against an archway inside the belfry.

SOUND OF CHOPPER in distance. Joker hears it.

JOKER
(into his radio)
Step on it. I'll be on the roof.

SUDDENLY, Batman appears behind Joker's shoulder. He
jerks an arm around Joker's neck, pinning him against
archway.

BATMAN
Have you danced with the devil in
the pale moonlight?

Joker jumps off the ground. He tries to get away.
Batman wraps his other arm around and, "click," hand-
cuffs himself to the Joker.

BATMAN
Well, now's your big chance.

Joker struggles. He twists and turns the handcuffs but
can't shift them. He can hardly move.

JOKER
(pulling a Joker
flower from his coat)
That was dumb. Now I'm going to
have to operate.

Joker SQUIRTS acid on the handcuffs.

Batman slips his arms back around Joker, pulling him into
the open. They stand tethered face-to-face. Joker hits
Batman hard, Batman returns the blow, Joker hits again,
and Batman returns.

The Joker gives a tremendous tug and the SIZZLING HAND-
CUFFS BREAK. He runs to the wooden louvers.

Joker breaks a 2 by 4 from the wooden framework of belfry
and SMASHES Batman with it.

Batman goes down. Joker hits him again. HELICOPTER AP-
PROACHES and dangles ladder over parapet. Joker STEPS
OUT onto parapet. He grabs for the dangling ladder.

Batman looks up from where he has fallen.

HIS POV

UP INTO belfry where there are thousands of Bats stirring.

ON BATMAN

He activates a sonar device on his belt. A SHRILL WHINE
lifts into the air.

CUT TO:

EXT. BELLTOWER PARAPET - THAT MOMENT

Helicopter HOVERS at the side of the belltower. Joker
steps up onto the wall between two GARGOYLES and puts
his foot onto one of the rungs of the ladder. He looks
up as he hears UNEARTHLY SCREAMING FROM BELFRY.

EXT. BELLTOWER PARAPET - THAT MOMENT

Suddenly the AIR IS FULL OF BATS, diving and flapping
all over the place. The NOISE from Batman's belt CLIMBS
IN PITCH. As it does so the bats fly faster. They swarm
above Joker in an ever thickening black cloud.

EXT. BELLTOWER PARAPET - MOMENTS LATER

The swarm of bats sweeps out and engulfs him. He SCREAMS,
tries to beat them off.

ON BATS

Suddenly Batman steps through the cloud.

He grabs Joker. Pulling him off the ladder. Batman
lifts him bodily up off the ground by front of his coat.
He pushes him back against a Gargoyle.

Joker struggles and the Gargoyle crumbles and Joker
slips backward. Joker knows he's a dead man, and he
smiles. He grabs for Batman's cowl and grips it as he
falls.

JOKER
I saved the last dance for you.
Both of them tumble down into the endless darkness.

EXT. CATHEDRAL TOWER - NIGHT

Two bodies fall in pas de deux. Joker SCREAMS. SOUND OF
WIND RUSHING BY.

EXT. FALLING POV - NIGHT

CAMERA FALLS DOWNWARD. Lights float lazily up AT us from
the onrushing street below.

EXT. FALLING - NIGHT - TIGHT

BATMAN FIRES a hook and a line back up at the roof.

ON HOOK

It lands on roof and skitters along looking for a crevice
to hook on.

ON JOKER

He stares back at Batman as he drifts away. JOKER'S
LAUGHING ALL THE WAY DOWN.

ON HOOK

SKITTERING.

ON BATMAN

He spreads his cape, slowing down a bit.

ON GARGOYLE

Hook skitters to it and seizes on its grimacing jaws.

ON JOKER (SLOW MOTION)

He plummets to earth CRASHING ON CATHEDRAL STEPS.
LAUGHTER STOPS!

ON BATMAN (SLOW MOTION)

HE FALLS, TURNS UPSIDE-DOWN AND STOPS in mid-air.

Coming to the end of a long tether from the top of the
tower. He bounces a bit and hangs upside-down. Like a
bat. A SCREAM fills the air.

EXT. CHURCH STEPS - OVERHEAD ANGLE

We're looking DOWN AT the Joker, whose body lies splayed
and broken on the steps. We DRIFT DOWNWARD, CLOSER,
until his FACE FILLS THE SCREEN, his chilling grin still
intact.

The Joker's expression is almost childlike, as he stares
aimlessly at the stars.

A FLASHBULB POPS --

REVERSE ANGLE

to see Vicki Vale, taking the photo of the year. She
looks down at him and shakes her head. A SHOUT FROM
ELSEWHERE wakes her up.

VOICE
Batman's fallen to the ground.
Over there.

Vicki spins around. LOOKS in that direction and follows
the voice.

EXT. CATHEDRAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

People run toward the place where Batman has fallen.

CLOSER

We see the figure of Batman completely covered with his
cape, face-down in the courtyard. A CIRCLE OF PEOPLE,
press, and police surround him. Commissioner Gordon
steps into the circle.

VOICE
Turn him over, now we'll see who
this guy is.

Gordon approaches the body.

Vicki RUSHES UP. Looks down at the cape-covered body.
Looking at her camera, conflicted, she raises it to take
her prize photo.

ON CAPE

-- as Gordon pulls back cape and turns over the body.

TIGHT ON FACE

-- it's not Bruce Wayne, it's a groggy Alexander Knox
(in his own clothes).

ON VICKI

-- she flashes a picture and brings down her camera. A
smile plays across her face.

ON KNOX

-- he blinks his eyes at the light.

KNOX
Can I still make the late edition?

EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE SQUARE - NIGHT

Through a crowd, A MAN walks into a side street. He
turns around. It's Bruce Wayne. He's got his utility
belt over his shoulder. He DISAPPEARS into the darkness.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - EVENING

It's majestic. WIND RUSTLES through the trees.

DENT (V.O.)
All right members of the press,
Commissioner Gordon and I have a
few announcements to make.

CUT TO:

EXT. PRESS CONFERENCE - NEXT EVENING

A large group of press gathers outside the courthouse to
hear Dent, Mayor and Gordon sum up the events.

DENT
First of all -- to clear up a
little misunderstanding. Gotham
Globe reporter Alexander Knox
is NOT Batman.

ALL HEADS turn to see blushing Knox. He grins and
touches the bandage on his head.

KNOX
On the other hand, he's not
Alexander Knox.

GORDON
Our police officers have recovered
and although some of them have
sworn off coffee, they're all back
on duty.

Mare LAUGHTER -- Vicki steps up next to Allie.

KNOX
Aren't you covering this press
conference Vicki?

VICKI
No, I'm gonna disappear a while.

Unexpectedly Vicki kisses Allie on the lips, long and
sweet. He is stunned.

VICKI
It was a ride, wasn't it Allie?
See you around.

KNOX
Wait a minute. What about us?

Vicki is already down the street.

KNOX
What about the Pulitzer prize?

VICKI
You get mine for me Allie.

She WALKS AWAY. Allie steps out into the street.
SHOUTS.

KNOX
Well what about your picture of
Batman?

VICKI
(over her shoulder,
with irony)
If he wants his picture taken,
he knows where to find me.

ON DENT

-- he now has the stage.

DENT
We received a letter from Batman
this morning.
(reading)
Gotham City's earned a rest from
crime... But if the forces of evil
should rise again, to cast a
shadow on the heart of the city.
Call me.

ON PRESS

-- they are quiet.

KNOX
Question. How do we call him?

GORDON
He gave us a signal.

ON GORDON

-- he steps to a searchlight and flips it on.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY WIDE - NIGHT

On the side of the old cathedral, the BATSIGNAL - the
yellow moon, a black-caped man, the melancholy icon
calling for help in the dark night of Gotham City.

EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT

FOOTSTEPS down the street. As they get closer WE SEE
it's Vicki. She passes by an old building. SOMETHING
RUNS INTO her. She looks down to see TWO LITTLE BOYS
dressed in homemade Batman costumes.

LITTLE BOY
Sorry lady, we was playin' Batman.

They TAKE OFF past her. She looks after them smiling.

A SOUND somewhere in the darkness above. She turns to
look.

EXT. TOP OF BUILDING - NIGHT

BACKLIT, Batman, silently looking down at her.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

She gazes up at him. A limousine is suddenly next to
her. She looks in. It's Alfred.

ALFRED
I thought champagne might be in
order, Ma'am.

Vicki smiles, GETS IN BACK.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Vicki settles in. Champagne and crystal set in back-
seat. Alfred DRIVES OFF.

ALFRED
Mr. Wayne said to tell you he'd
be a bit late.

VICKI
I'm not surprised Alfred. I'm
not surprised.

EXT. ABOVE THE STREET - NIGHT

Batman watches, dances across a rooftop. BATSIGNAL IN
BACKGROUND.

FADE OUT.

INT. A STUFFY MANSION--A NIGHT ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO

The viewer floats through an overbearing mansion and
up its sweeping staircase to where a stern man in
conservative dress is pacing back and forth, smoking a
cigarette in a cigarette holder. He is the FATHER. The
throes-of-labor pants and moans of the MOTHER can be
heard from down the hall.

Now, eerie Gaas and Goos chill the air. The Father stops
and gapes the cigarette holder out of his mouth to see a
dazed NURSE shuffle out of the birth room and disappear
down the hallway.

A TRAUMATIZED DOCTOR next wanders out. The Father runs
past him into the room. The viewer remains outside and
hears the Father's subsequent screams.

INT. MANSION LIVING ROOM--CHRISTMAS EVE PAST

A bizarrely corrugated Cage sits amid the plush, period,
and Christmased-up surroundings of the mansion. With
their backs turned to the sickly squeals emerging from
the Playpen from Hell, Father and Mother, holding
martinis, look out a window of gentle snowfall, with
bloodshot eyes. A 50's-type radio warbles "Santa Claus
is coming to Town."

A strange pair of eyes peer from the cage. Taking the
point of view of the eyes from inside the playpen, one
sees the mansion's Christmas tree from between the dark
cage slats.

GIDDY YULETIDE SINGERS
"He knows when you are sleeping,
he knows when you're awake..."

The family cat skulks past the cage -- almost. Without
warning, the cat is yanked -- so fast and powerfully it
seems that it's been sucked -- through the bars, into the
cage. A feline SCREAM, then sickening silence.

With dead syncopation, Mother and Father finish off their
martinis, and plop the empty glasses down.

EXT. A PARK--THAT NIGHT

A HAPPY COUPLE in 50's dress, pushes a baby carriage
through the park cooing toward their bundle of joy
inside.

Father and Mother straggle from the other direction,
creaking forward an ominously closed-up, wickedly de-
signed baby carriage that serves to muffle nasty whining
and thumping noises.

HAPPY COUPLE
Merry Christmas!

Father and Mother fake a smiling response that collapses
as the happy couple passes. They then brake at a story-
book bridge over a bubbling brook. With dark nonchalance,
Father and Mother each grab an end of the carriage and
heave it upward.

EXT. THE CARRIAGE--NIGHT

swirls in the air and splashes down into the small river.
Right side up, the carriage gently rides the tranquil
rapids out of the park area. It bobs through an open
sewer tunnel pipe.

INT. THE SEWER--NIGHT

The carriage innocently slides through the murky waters
of the awesomely cavernous and creepy sewer, softly
surfing its sides.

INT. A DARK LAIR--NIGHT

The resilient carriage spews from a gaping pipe into a
moat of water that surrounds a vast patch of snow and
ice that is the centerpiece of a dark and mysterious
lair.

The carriage rides a gentle wave onto the sanctuary's
arctic island, into a patch of light. From out of the
darkness of the lair, FOUR STATUESQUE EMPEROR PENGUINS
WITH DISTINGUISHED GRAY BELLIES regally approach the
carriage and surround it with spooky authority.

FROM OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF THE OPENING CREDITS WE
GO TO...

EXT. A DISPLAY WINDOW--EARLY EVENING OF THE CURRENT ERA

A Batman logo fills the frame with a portentous soundtrack
boom. A playful salvo of snowballs reverberates against
this image as the logo is revealed to be a hanging center-
piece in the display window of a store that sells Batman
sleds, lunch boxes, T-shirts, and ticking-to-twenty-
before-Seven clocks.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--EARLY EVENING

Bathed in pristine snow and packed with ELATED SHOPPERS,
POINSETTIA GRASPING LOVERS, BLESSED CAROLERS, and an
overwhelming array of Christmas decoration, the intimate
Plaza center of Gotham City has been dragged kicking and
screaming into a state of beauty and happiness.

An ALL-AMERICAN DAD holds up a bowed Batman sled to an
ALL-AMERICAN MOM. An ALL-AMERICAN SON rushes up causing
All-American Dad to exaggeratedly hide the present behind
his back.

Just behind them, an ADORABLE LITTLE GIRL takes a dollar
from her precious little purse and gives it to a
SALVATION ARMY SANTA. A sweet, microphoned voice wafts
out over the Plaza.

SWEET MICROPHONED VOICE (O.S.)
Could I have your attention, Gotham
City?

EXT. FROM AN ELEVATED STAGE AT THE CENTER OF THE
PLAZA--EVENING

A dewy-eyed young lovely, wearing a snow bunny fur, a
tiara, and a banner streamed across her chest that reads
ICE PRINCESS, continues into her mike. An Elegant Lampost
Clock, near the stage, ticks fifteen minutes till seven.

ICE PRINCESS
It's time for tonight's Lighting
of the Tree! How 'bout that!

The merry Consumers stop to watch the Ice Princess scurry
to an IMMENSE VIBRANTLY MULTI-COLORED BUTTON and press it
down. This causes a mammoth Christmas Tree to light up.
The crowd erupts in aahs and oohs.

INT. A VERTICAL SEWER GRATE--EVENING

Through a grand, vertical half-circle sewer grate, an
older pair of strange eyes peer. Taking the point of
view of the eyes through the grate slats, one sees the
blazing Christmas Tree, just as one did through the
Playpen bars.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE SEWER GRATE--EVENING

A pair of black webbed hands -- flippers, really -- curl
out around the grate bars. Eerily poking out next is a
twisted bird-like nose and a creepy pair of barely audible
lips.

THE CREEPY LIPS
"I know when you are sleeping, I
know when you're awake."

The world's most beloved butler, ALFRED, marches past the
sewer grate, past a PAPERBOY who bustles up, holding a
newspaper headlined "PENGUIN -- MAN OR MYTH OR SOMETHING
WORSE?"

PAPERBOY
Read about the latest sighting of
the Penguin creature! He was seen
torching a homeless shelter,
robbing a blind --

ALFRED
Dear Boy! Sometimes it is a
diversion to read such piffle.
Most times it is a waste of time.

Alfred suddenly feels a chill from behind, and below him.
He turns to the sewer grate just as the slimy flippers
disappear into the darkness.

EXT. THE TOP OF THE SHRECK BUILDING--NIGHT

The viewer goes from Gotham's bowels to its summit. The
top floor of the building housing the department store
is a tower of Ivory with a large, friendly sentinel of
a cat at its tippy top. Two men stand in the window,
pointing down to the Plaza below.

INT. MAX SHRECK'S CONFERENCE ROOM--NIGHT

The conference room presents itself in its high-tech
splendor. A mighty Shreck Corporation logo of a friendly
cat adorns one wall.

The two men are MAX SHRECK and THE MAYOR. Max is a
pillar of community charisma. The Mayor is more
straightforward, less spectacular.

MAYOR
Well here's hoping ... With Batman
protecting us, and all your enterprises
keeping our economy on full boil,
Gotham just might have its first
real Christmas in a good long while.

MAX
(nods, then)
I feel almost vulgar, in this
Yuletide context, about mentioning
the new power plant.
But if we're gonna break ground
when we've gotta break ground,
I'll need permits, variances, tax
incentives ... that sort of pesky
nonsense.

Evidently, this is the first the Mayor has heard of it.

MAYOR
"Power plant"? Max, our studies
show that Gotham has enough energy
sources to sustain growth into the
next cen--

MAX
(scoffs)
Your analysts are talking growth
at one percent per annum. That's
not growth, that's a mild swelling.
I'm planning ahead for a
revitalized Gotham City ... So we
can light the whole plaza without
worrying about brownouts ... Do
you like the sound of "brownouts"?
Do you?

Behind them, Max's football-hero son CHIP (as in Chip off
the old block) enters, with SELINA KYLE, Max's beautiful-
beneath-bifocals-and-a-subdued-haircut assistant. She
sets down fresh coffee for Max and the Mayor.

MAX
Imagine a Gotham City of the future
lit up like a blanket of stars ...
but blinking on and off,
embarrassingly low on juice.
Frankly I cringe, Mr. Mayor.

Chip glances to a fierce digital clock showing 6:50.

CHIP
Dad. Mr. Mayor ... It's time to
go downstairs and bring joy to the
masses.

Max looks to the Mayor: what's it gonna be?

MAYOR
(curt)
Sorry. You'll have to submit
reports, blueprints and plans to
the usual committees, through the
usual channels.

This isn't what Max wants to hear. But before he can
retort:

SELINA
Um, I had a suggestion. Well,
really, actually more of just a
question ...

Max turns, goggle-eyed at the impertinence.

MAX
I'm afraid we haven't properly
house-broken Ms. Kyle. In the
plus column, though, she knows
how to brew coffee.

As Chip follows his father and the Mayor out he tells
Selina, re the untouched coffee.

CHIP
Thanks. Y'know it's not the
caffeine that buzzes us -- it's
the obedience.

Now Selina is alone.

SELINA
Shut up, Chip.

Then she slaps her forehead with her palm.

SELINA
"Actually more of just a question."
You stupid corn dog. Corn dog.
Corn dog.

EXT. OUTSIDE SHRECK'S DEPARTMENT STORE--NIGHT

Max, his son and the Mayor roll out from beneath the
SHRECK sign, through popping flashbulbs and happy
Gothamites.

Max smoothly hands a fifty and a second bill to a
Salvation Army Santa. Santa checks the second bill.
It's a single.

CHIP
Watch your step, Dad, it's pretty
grotesque...

Max gracefully side-steps an island of melting sludge.
We follow its oozing stream down into a sewer grate.

INT. BELOW IN THE SEWER--NIGHT

A silhouette of a squat, gnarled figure responds to the
icky drizzle by flapping open an umbrella, in shadow.

EXT. THE STAGE--NIGHT

As Max and the Mayor move -- both smiling -- to the dais:

MAX
I have enough signatures -- from
Shreck employees alone -- to warrant
a recall. That's not a threat.
Just simple math.

MAYOR
Maybe. But you don't have an issue,
Max. Nor do you have a candidate.

The elegant clock behind them says five minutes till
seven. Max and the Mayor both peck the Ice Princess's
cheek. Now the Mayor takes the mike. With forced
joviality:

MAYOR
The man who's given this city so much
is here, to keep giving. Welcome
Gotham's own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.

INT. MAX'S OUTER OFFICE--NIGHT

Selina sullenly scribbles "Obey" on a post-it pad which
she then sticks on the edge of her computer beside other
girlishly masochistic post-its like "Don't 'get' jokes"
and "Save it for your diary".

Selina pouts at the sound of the cheering crowd. A
phone rings. She just stares at it. Then past it, to
a legal pad sheet with the word SPEECH scribbled atop
it. Selina pops to it in a panic.

SELINA
Darn. Darn.

EXT. THE STAGE--NIGHT

Max, the Mayor, and his staff proudly hurl small wrapped
boxes into the eager audience. Max then stops to unzip
a hand-size portfolio--it is empty. He then gives a calm,
clenched-teeth hiss to Chip.

MAX
Forgot. My. Speech. Remind me to
take it out on Selina.
(into mike)
"Santa Claus"? 'Fraid not. I'm
just a poor schmoe who got a little
lucky, and sue me if I want to give
a little back. I only wish I could
hand out more than just expensive
baubles. I wish I could hand out
World Peace, and Unconditional
Love, wrapped in a big bow.

INT. SEWER BELOW THE STAGE--NIGHT

The umbrella closes to reveal a POV of the babbling Max
up through a stage-side sewer grate.

A RASP
Oh, but you can. Oh, but you
will ...

His clammy flipper rises up, barely into the light, to
flick open a rusted, ornately battered time-piece. One
minute till.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--NIGHT

A GARGANTUAN CHRISTMAS PRESENT WITH A COLOSSAL RED BOW
is suddenly seen floating into the Plaza. Citizens turn
their heads from the stage to gasp in wonder.

Behind the Adorable Little Girl, Alfred reaches a parked
Wayne Rolls Royce and tosses in his present. He pulls off
a ticket from the windshield with a huff, then looks out
to the big present. Warily.

The alarms on the clocks in the Batman Store window go
off at seven o' clock.

EXT. THE STAGE--NIGHT

The Mayor admires the Mega-gift. Grudgingly:

MAYOR
Great idea.

MAX
(mystified)
But not mine...

Max drops a present. It lands atop the sewer grate
below.

INT. THE SEWER BELOW--NIGHT

Angle on a shadow of the face of the man one calls
PENGUIN.

PENGUIN
Deck the halls.

EXT. THE PLAZA--NIGHT

One can make out motorcycle wheels churning beneath the
box and even some moving feet when suddenly the front
of the box tears open. With a rebel yell, a GANG of
SURLY CARNIVAL DENIZENS WITH RED TRIANGLES TATTOOED OVER
THEIR LEFT EYES blitzkrieg the crowd, which includes
Alfred, who protectively bolts toward the Little Girl.

A STRONGMAN COVERED IN TATTOOS emerges out of the box to
slam the All-American Dad and swipe his Batman sled,
which Strongman then uses to hammer down Santa Claus.

EXT. BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT STORE--NIGHT

Oblivious, Selina rushes out with Max's speech.

A TRIO OF SCOWLING BIKERS buzz her to the ground.

The Batman sled crunches against a frosty police wind-
shield. A disgruntled COMMISSIONER GORDON sputters out
into his radio.

GORDON
What are you waiting for? The
Signal!

EXT. THE GOTHAM SKY--NIGHT

THE RENOWNED BAT BEACON blazes onto the edge of the night.

INT. WAYNE MANOR--NIGHT

The Bat Beacon can be seen through an elegant mansion
window.

Its reflection is picked up in an ornate mirror in the
grand living room and then followed to another
strategically placed mirror. The reflection glows
against the face of a sitting-in-darkness Bruce Wayne.
He moves out of the light.

INT. THE SEWER--NIGHT

Through the grate bars, the beacon in the sky can be made
out, accompanied by strange squawks.

THE RASP OF PENGUIN
Ooh, Batman... You gonna piss on
my parade..?

EXT. THE PLAZA--NIGHT

A FIRE BREATHER smashes open a big hole in the Batman
Store display window with his Fire-rod. He sticks his
rod in his mouth, then bellows a cloud of flame onto the
Batman merchandise.

Amid the chaos of whimpering victims and dropped shopping
bags, a fleeing Ice Princess shoves an Elderly Woman to
the ground.

EXT. THE STAGE--NIGHT

Monkeys with cap-pistols frolic on the shoulders of a man
equipped with an organ-grinder-Gatling-gun, as he fires
artillery into the Christmas tree, blasting off ornaments,
cables, and lights. Max and the Mayor hit the deck.

ORGAN GRINDER
Take that, tannenbaum!

A FAT CLOWN leaps onto the stage with a WICKEDLY DRESSED
DAME, who wears an assortment of knives, and a RAGGEDY
SWORD SWALLOWER who chokes up an Excaliber.

KNIFETHROWER DAME
Relax. We just came for the guy
who runs the show.

The Mayor bravely steps forward.

MAYOR
What do you want from me?

Laughing, the Sword Swallower pushes him off the stage.

SWORD SWALLOWER
Not you. Shreck.

Now Chip heroically stands.

CHIP
You'll have to go through me.

FAT CLOWN
All this courage. Goosebump-city.

Simultaneously the Knifethrower whip-throws a knife that
grazes Chip's ear.

MAX
Son!

CHIP
Dad! Save yourself!

Max has already dashed off the dais.

EXT./INT. BATMOBILE--NIGHT

The Batmobile rockets toward the viewer, the bat insignia
reflecting off the windshield. It plows through the
gargantuan "present," shredding it to pieces.

Three STILT-WALKERS are viciously kicking the crowd.

BATMAN slams down a lever.

Twin blades sprout from the Batmobile's sides, like
wings, to saw off the stilts, whose owners now crash
down, face-first.

Out of slots, Batman fires a whooshing array of small,
black, metal frisbees into the heads of some Carnival
gangsters and Bikers.

Now he focuses upon the Tattooed Strongman, chasing
Alfred and the Little girl.

Alfred looks to the oncoming Batmobile and knowingly
ducks. A black frisbee savagely jettisons over his head,
into the Tattooed Strongman's face, crumpling him to the
ground. Alfred rises up to broadly beam at the passing
Batmobile.

EXT. PLAZA SIDE STREET--NIGHT

Max huffs with growing confidence, into a less crowded
sidestreet. He trots over a sewer grate.

INT. BENEATH THIS SIDE-STREET SEWER GRATE--NIGHT

Loud animalistic panting and splashing sounds are heard
as we watch Max stamping across the grate.

EXT. THE PLAZA--NIGHT

Three Clowns spin and fire frantically at the charging
Batmobile. One dives out of the way.

The other Two (one, a midget) slam atop the hood as
Batman roars toward the Batman store and the Fire-
breather blaspheming the display window.

The woozy hood-top clowns raise their guns toward the
windshield, while the escaped Clown rains bullets against
its back window.

Batman brakes the Batmobile. The Hoodtop Clowns sail
into the stunned Firebreather and all three land on the
merchandising.

Batman twists a square black Knob. A powerful STEEL JACK-
TYPE DEVICE jets out the bottom of the Batmobile and
lifts the vehicle up off the ground. The Batmobile does
a sharp 180 degree spin. Batman re-twists the knob. The
jack slams back up into the Batmobile.

The Exhaust of the spun-around Batmobile volcanoes toward
the gaping Firebreather, fittingly setting him on fire,
along with both clowns. The Batmobile thunders at the
clown who'd escaped.

This clown grabs innocent bystander Selina Kyle. In the
scuffle, a heel cracks off one of her shoes.

The blitzing Batmobile comes to a skidding halt. The
Clown presses a sleek stun-gun to Selina's neck.

SELINA
I probably shouldn't bring this up,
but this is a very serious pair
of shoes you ruined. Couldn't you
have just been a prince and broken
my jaw? My body will heal, but
this was the last pair left in my
size.

CLOWN
All these innocent bystanders and I
had to pick you ...SHUT UP!

The Batmboile door whooshes open. Batman pounds straight
at the Clown, an eerie force of nature. An ACROBAT
somersaults into his face. Batman casually punches his
lights out.

CLOWN
Listen up, Mister Man-bat, you
take one step closer and I'll...

BATMAN
Sure.

Batman gunslingers out his grapple speargun. The wired
hook rockets past the clown's jerking away head and into
the wall behind him.

CLOWN
(jeers)
Nice shot, Mister...

Batman yanks the wire, ripping off a chunk of wall that
smacks the back of the clown's head. As he staggers:

SELINA
You shouldn'a left the other heel.

With her surviving heel, she kicks the Crumpled Clown's
knee, knocking him and the stun gun to the ground.

Batman bends to his vanquished foe. Touches the triangle
tattoo over his left eye, as Selina gushes:

SELINA
Wow. The Batman--or is it just
"Batman"? Your choice. Of course.

Batman finds himself staring at the lovely young woman.
For a moment, time freezes.

BATMAN
Gotta go.

In a wink, he's a half-block away, being schmoozed by
Commissioner Gordon. Onlookers CHEER.

It's just Selina alone here with her unconscious attacker.

SELINA
Well. That was ... very brief.
Like most men in my life. What
men? Well, there's you, but ...
you need therapy.

She kneels beside the Clown. Picks up his stun-gun.
Zaps him, jolting his body a bit.

SELINA
Electroshock therapy. What a
bargain -- we both feel better.

EXT. PLAZA SIDE STREET--NIGHT

Hearing the sounds of cheers, Max smiles and stops atop
a manhole to wipe his brow. Suddenly, the manhole cracks
in half, sucking down a wailing Max. The manhole flaps
back up into a normal, seemingly untouched position.

EXT. THE PLAZA--NIGHT

The Commissioner hustles to keep pace with Batman.

GORDON
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
(good natured huff)
Thanks for making the rest of us look
like a bunch of dolts ... I'm afraid
the Red Triangle Circus Gang is back.

BATMAN
We'll see...

Now the Mayor bustles up.

MAYOR
The Caped Crusader. We don't
deserve you! They almost made off
with our mover and shaker, Max
Shreck. But --

Belatedly it dawns on the Mayor. He looks around,
blinking.

MAYOR
Where is that insufferable
sonovabitch?

Then he turns back, to Batman. But Batman has vanished,
too.

INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT--LATER THAT NIGHT

Selina enters, hanging up her winter coat and calling out.

SELINA
Honey, I'm home.
(then)
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

She wearily laughs at her private joke, then takes in her
'90's quaint, "feminine" apartment -- pink carpet, cute
linoleum, a neon "HELLO THERE!" on the wall --

-- a meticulous doll house, a quilt-in-progress, a pretty
embarrassing assortment of stuffed animals and a Christmas
tree.

Through her open window, a feisty, beautiful CAT slinks in.

SELINA
Miss Kitty ... Back from more
sexual escapades you refuse to
share ... not that I'd ever pry.
Drink your dinner.

She sets out a dish of milk. Miss Kitty comes over, purring.

SELINA
What did you just purr? "How can
anyone be so pathetic?" Yes, to
you I seem pathetic. But I'm a
working girl, gotta pay the rent.
Maybe if you were chipping in,
'stead of stepping out ...

She passes childhood PHOTOS of a younger happier Selina on
a trampoline, on a horse, on a mountain face ... then
turns on her answering machine.

As it plays, she opens her Murphy bed, turns down the
covers ...

MOM'S VOICE
(stern)
Selina dear. It's your mother.
Just calling to say hello --

SELINA
Yeah right, "but" --

MOM'S VOICE
-- "but" I'm disappointed you're not
coming home for Christmas. I was
looking forward to discussing your
life. To hearing just why you
insist on languishing in Gotham
City as some lowly secretary --

SELINA
Lowly "assistant". Thank you.

She fast forwards to:

LAME BOYFRIEND'S VOICE
Selina, about that Christmas
getaway we planned? I'll be going
alone. Doctor Shaw says I need to
be my own person now, and not an
appendage.

SELINA
(scoffs)
Some appendage.

As she fast forwards:

SELINA
The party never stops on Selina
Kyle's answering machine ... Guess
I should've let him win that last
racquetball game.

Onto the next message:

GRUFF WOMAN
Selina ... We've missed you at the
rape prevention class ... It's not
enough to master martial arts. Hey,
Elvis knew those moves, and he died
fat. You must stop seeing yourself
as a vict--

Onward. Miss Kitty compassionately snuggles beside her,
as:

SELINA'S OWN VOICE
Hi, Selina, this is yourself
calling. To remind you, honey,
that you have to come all the way
back to the office unless you
remembered to bring home the Bruce
Wayne file, because the meeting's
on Wednesday and Max Slavemaster
will freak if every pertinent fact
is not at your lovely tapered
fingertips.

Selina fires her stun gun at the answering machine, jolt-
ing it off. Again, she slaps her forehead with her hand.
Then goes to her closet, puts her coat back on. As she
exits:

SELINA
The file! You stupid corn dog.
Corn dog. Deep fried! Corn dog ...

EXT. THE OLD GOTHAM ZOO--NIGHT

The viewer is suddenly wafting over the creepy panorama
of an abandoned Zoo Expo Area.

We whoosh downward to a DECREPIT "ARCTIC WORLD" PAVILION,
and through its Colossal, cracked Observation window.

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR--NIGHT

We continue to squirm down the walls of the lair where
Penguin found his home, before settling to a tight glimpse
of Max Shreck slumped over the edge of a block of ice.

Max teeters up into consciousness, glancing to his side
to see a grand Emperor Penguin curiously staring at him.
Max yelps. The Penguin yelps back.

Calming himself, Max turns to face forward, then screams
again. The block of ice is revealed to be a strange con-
ference table populated by the Red Triangle Circus Gang,
including: a disturbingly Ratty Poodle and its matching
owner, a Ratty POODLE LADY; the Organ Grinder and his two
monkeys; the Tattooed Strongman; the Sword Swallower; the
Knifethrowing Dame; the Fat and Thin Clowns; the three
Stiltwalkers; Flame, the Snakewoman; and four ND acrobats.

An awesome, SEEDY ELECTRICAL GENERATOR wires to a massive
air conditioner, wheezes sparks with a malevolent hum.

The gang's snickering now fades into respectful silence.

Actual penguins of every size heedlessly horseplay in
the icy moat. Now we hear the sound of a drip. Max
turns...The drip is seen thudding against an umbrella
improbably held by one of the penguins. As he emerges
from the pack, we see that he wears a grimy coat. Then
he flaps down his umbrella, revealing his face for the
first time in glory. It is not a penguin but The Penguin.

PENGUIN
Hi.

Max launches into a face-contorting wail, but his shock
prevents him from emitting actual sound. He closes his
mouth then tries another Munchesque wail to no aural effect.

PENGUIN
I believe the word you're looking
for is...A-A-A-A-A-G-H-!

Then:

PENGUIN
Actually this is all just a bad
dream. You're home in bed.
Heavily sedated, resting
comfortably, and dying from the
carcinogens you've personally
spewed in a lifetime of profiteering.
Tragic irony or poetic justice?
You tell me.

MAX
My god ... it's true. The Penguin-
Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--

PENGUIN
Quiet, Max. What do you think,
this is a conversation?

Max shuts right up. Penguin idly "tries out" his little
umbrella -- it spits fire. Satisfied, he sets it down.

PENGUIN
We have something in common, we
two ... We're both perceived as
monsters. But, somehow, you're a
well-respected monster, and I am...
to date... not.

There is a small arsenal of umbrellas at his feet. He
picks up another one: it shoots knives.

MAX
(mustering courage)
Frankly I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman. Tough, yes.
Shrewd, okay. But that doesn't
make me a mon--

Penguin cuts him off with a CACKLE.

PENGUIN
Don't embarrass yourself, Max. I
know all about you. What you hide,
I discover. What you put in your
toilet, I place on my mantlepiece.
Get the picture?

Penguin is playing with a third umbrella. He begins to
twirl it at Max -- it's got a bright spiral pattern, like
one of those cheesy "hypno-disks" from the backs of
comic books.

MAX
What, is that supposed to
"hypnotize" me?

PENGUIN
No, just give you a splitting
headache.

MAX
Well it's not working.

Penguin "fires" the umbrella at Max -- a DEAFENING
gunshot. Max flies back in horror: Am I hit?

PENGUIN
You big baby! Just blanks. Would
I go to all this trouble tonight
just to kill you? No, I have an
entirely "other" purpose.

Suddenly Penguin is solemn, subdued -- is that a tear in
his eye?

PENGUIN
I'm ready, Max. I've been
lingering down here too long. I'm
starting to like the smell ... bad
sign. It's high time for me to
ascend. To re-emerge. With your
help, your know-how, your savvy,
your acumen. I wasn't born in the
sewer, you know. I come from ...

He looks up, at a place far above the sewers.

PENGUIN
Like you. And, like you, I want
some respect ... a recognition of
my basic humanity ... an occasional
breeze ...

Even the Circus Gang looks touched. Max stays poker-
faced.

PENGUIN
Most of all, I want to find out who
I am. By finding my parents.
Learning my "human" name. Simple
stuff that the good people of
Gotham take for granted.

MAX
(boy, is he tough)
And exactly why am I gonna help
you?

On cue, one of the Carny Creeps hands Penguin a grimy
Christmas stocking with "Max" disturbingly stitched on it.

PENGUIN
Well, let's start with a batch of
toxic waste from your "clean"
textile plant. There's a whole
lagoon of this crud, in the back...

He pulls a rusty thermos from the stocking and, from the
thermos, pours some goo onto the tabletop, which sizzles.

MAX
Yawn. That coulda come from anywhere.

PENGUIN
What about the documents that prove
you own half the firetraps in Gotham?

MAX
If there were such documents -- and
that is not an admission -- I would
have seen to it they were shredded.

Another Carny Goon hands over a sheaf of papers -- they've
been shredded, but carefully placed together with tape.

PENGUIN
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference. By the way,
how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?

MAX
(rattled)
Fred. Fred? He's ... actually he's
been on an extended vacation, and --

From under the table, Penguin pulls out a discolored human
hand and happily waves it at a whitened Max.

PENGUIN
(ventriloquist)
Hi, Max. Remember me? I'm Fred's
hand.
(leans forward)
Want to greet any other body parts?
Or stroll down memory lane, with
torn-up kinky Polaroids? Failed
urine tests? Remember, Max ...
You flush it, I flaunt it.

Max sits here -- chastened, thoughtful, considering all
the incriminating evidence before him. Now he manages
a smile.

MAX
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir?
I think perhaps I could help
orchestrate a little welcome-home
scenario for you. And once we're
both back home, perhaps we can
help each other out ...

PENGUIN
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

He puts out a hand. Max shakes. Penguin abruptly pulls
his flipper away, leaving Max holding "Fred"'s severed
paw.

The Carny Crew booms in laughter. Max offers a weak giggle.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA - NEXT DAY

The Mayor, accompanied by TV news-cams, grimly tours the
scene of last night's rampage. Accompanied by his Wife,
holding their BABY (great photo op) and an appropriately
solemn Max.

MAYOR
(to reporters)
I tell you this, not just as an
official, but as a husband and
father ... last night's eruption
of lawlessness will never hap--

Suddenly from behind the ravaged Tree, an ACROBAT-THUG
somersaults at the Mayor's Wife, and snatches the Baby!
Then leaps onto the platform and holds the baby up, like
an Oscar.

ACROBAT-THUG
I'm not one for speeches, so I'll
just say "Thanks".

The Mayor lunges for the attacker and gets pivot-kicked
to the ground. The THUG races through a frightened crowd --

-- and falls into an open manhole. As bystanders gather,
and try to peer into the darkness below, we HEAR:

THUG'S VOICE
Hey! Oww!

Now the THUMPS of somebody taking a merciless pounding.
And the SCREAMS of the Thug. Now he comes scrambling out
of the manhole, dazed and empty-handed ... and madly
dashes away ...

Next, amid cries of "Stand back!" and "My God, look!" the
bystanders back off, revealing the spectacle of the
Mayor's tiny child levitating -- as if by magic -- from
the depths of purgatory. But no, it's not magic ...
it's ... Penguin! He holds the babe aloft in one yucky
but powerful flipper.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Alfred is standing on a stepladder attaching ornaments to a
Christmas tree, but finding his attention claimed by the TV.

Bruce is sitting on the couch, also entranced by the lead
item on the local news.

TV ANCHORMAN'S VOICE
This morning's miracle... Gotham
will never forget.

INSERT - TV SCREEN

The rest of the scene in Gotham Plaza plays out on video:

Now Penguin is fully out above the pavement, so we can
see how he'd miraculously floated up ... on a big Rubber
Duck attached to a tall scissor-lift. As CAMERA ZOOMS
IN:

ANCHORMAN'S VOICE
That's him: The shadowy, much
rumored penguin-man of the sewers,
arisen. Until today, he'd been
another tabloid myth, alongside
the Abominable Snowman and the Loch
Ness Monster ...

The Mayor's wife snatches up her baby in tears. Then,
fighting nausea, she embraces the modest, abashed
Penguin -- whose eyes heartbreakingly blink in the
unaccustomed light.

ANCHORMAN'S VOICE
But now this odd little man-beast
can proudly stand tall, alongside
our own legendary Batman.

The Mayor tries to shake Penguin's hand ... but somehow
Max Shreck is standing between them, patting Penguin's
back.

ANCHORMAN'S VOICE
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck,
had been on a fact-finding mission in
Gotham Plaza...

Shreck whispers something in Penguin's pointy little ear
-- c'mon, you're a hero, it's your moment. Embarrassed,
but -- aw, what the hell -- Penguin takes a little bow.

Gotham Plaza erupts. "Joy To The World" PEALS over the
PA.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bruce and Alfred are both frozen (Alfred's arm
outstretched to the tree, ornament dangling). Both still
staring, at:

INSERT - TV SCREEN

Penguin is in Gotham Plaza, doing a live interview.
Shabby but proud in his tattered cloak, shielding his eyes
with a small, touchingly frayed umbrella from the glare of
the studio lights. He haltingly, earnestly tells CAMERA:

PENGUIN
All I want in return ... is the
chance to ... to find my folks.
Find out who they are ... and,
thusly, who I am ... and then,
with my parents, just ... try to
understand why ... why they did
what I guess they felt they had
to do, to a child who was born
looking a little ... different.
A child who spent his first
Christmas, and many since, in a
sewer.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Alfred is back to trimming the tree. But Bruce still
stares at the TV screen. Presently:

ALFRED
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?

BRUCE
No, nothing, ah ...
(pause)
His parents ... I ... I hope he
finds them.

Alfred murmurs his agreement: that would be nice.

HOLD ON BRUCE as he continues to scrutinize the image of
the Penguin, on the screen...

EXT. HALL OF RECORDS - NEXT DAY

Press Photographers jostle to snap photos through the
windows of the baroque old building. Frustrated Journal-
ists, barred from the building by a row of Cops, inter-
view each other.

JOURNALIST 1
Whattaya think he'll do to his mom
and dad, when he finds 'em?

JOURNALIST 2
(stupid question)
What would you do to your mom and pa,
if they flushed you down the poop-
chute?

An AGGRESSIVE REPORTER tries to sneak in through a side
entrance. He's grabbed by two Shreck Security GUARDS.

GUARD 1
(escorting him off)
Mr. Penguin is not to be disturbed.

AGGRESSIVE REPORTER
(professional outrage)
The Hall of Records is a public
place! You're violating the First
Amendment, abridging the freedom
off the press --!

Suddenly Max Shreck is standing here, surrounded by a
posse of his own sympathetic reporters, who jot down every
pearl.

MAX
What about the freedom to rediscover
your roots, with dignity, with privacy?

AGGRESSIVE REPORTER
What's the deal, Mr. Shreck? Is
the Penguin a personal friend --?

He thrusts his tape-recorder at Max's mouth. Shreck
smiles.

MAX
Yes he's a personal friend. Of this
whole city. So have a heart, buddy.

He flicks off the reporter's Record button.

MAX
And give the Constitution a rest,
okay? It's Christmas.

INT. HALL OF RECORDS - DAY

We find Penguin alone in the vast, silent Main Hall.
Seated at an enormous table. Surrounded by files marked
"Birth Certificates" ... hundreds of thousands of birth
records of Gotham's citizens, past and present ...

... and Penguin is patiently checking each certificate,
"thumbing" through them all with his slimy left flipper...

His right flipper is wrapped around a pen. Every so
often, Penguin pauses, then jots down another name, on a
legal pad. So singleminded in his search, he doesn't hear
the muffled CRIES of his name, through the windows, from
reporters ...

DISSOLVE. It's night now. A cloak of DARKNESS through
the oversized windows ... even the press has gone home ...
but Penguin is still here, he hasn't budged.

Still methodically "flipping" through all those birth
certificates ... and still jotting down names ... male
names, boy names ... on a legal pad. He's filled many
pads by now -- a tall stack of them.

By the eerie light of a single table-lamp, he keeps
writing.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT

The Batmobile sleekly cruises down a deserted street.

INT. BATMOBILE (MOVING) - NIGHT

As Batman drives, Alfred's face comes on a screen inside
the Batmobile.

ALFRED
The city's been noticeably quiet
since the thwarted baby-napping
... yet still you patrol. What
about eating? Sleeping? You
won't be much good to anyone else
if you don't look after yourself.

BATMAN
The Red Triangle Circus Gang ...
they're jackals, Alfred. They
hunt in packs, at night --

ALFRED
Are you concerned about that
strange, heroic Penguin person?

Batman scoffs -- then glances out the window, at:

THE HALL OF RECORDS

Surprise, that's where he's cruising.

The one light inside still burns, throwing a long shadow
of the strange, hunched-over Penguin -- at his desk,
resolutely doing his research.

In front of the building are a Shreck Guard and a Police-
man. Both slumped on the front stairs, both snoozing.

INT. BATMOBILE - LATE NIGHT

As Batman drives around the Hall, checking the silent
street for trouble, then surveying the single lit window,
again:

BATMAN
(ambiguous)
Funny you should ask, Alfred.
Maybe I am a bit concerned.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

A MOB of PRESS, MORBID CURIOSITY-SEEKERS, even some over-
night PENGUIN-GROUPIES, try to muscle their way into this
grand, well-tended boneyard for the rich and expired.
Gotham's own Forest Lawn, and a flying wedge of the city's
FINEST, arms interlocked, keeps out the rabble, as ...

The Penguin, in threadbare black, waddles past the
manicured headstones to the twin markers etched with the
names Tucker Cobblepot and Esther Cobblepot.

Now, reaching his parents' final resting places, he falls
to his knees -- not very far to go. The plucks two wilted
old roses from his sleeve, and places one upon each plot.

From behind the police barricade, camera motor-drives
WHIRR. Not an instant of this drama is being lost to
posterity. A Penguin groupie faints. Around her, other
girls pick up the cue -- some wail, others swoon.

After a moment of silent contemplation, Penguin rises again.
Mournfully shambles back to the crowded cemetery entrance.

AGGRESSIVE REPORTER
(he's back)
So -- Mr. Penguin --!

PENGUIN
(quiet, tragic dignity)
I have a name. It's Oswald
Cobblepot.

AGGRESSIVE REPORTER
Mr. Cobblepot! You'll never get a
chance to settle up with 'em, huh?

Around him, the crowd gasps in shock at such nerve.

But Penguin doesn't look shocked, merely surprised. As
the flashbulbs flash (Penguin doesn't cringe -- he's
already used to this media mishegas) he pensively twirls
his umbrella and, in a reasonable facsimile of a soft,
sweet squawk:

PENGUIN
True. I was their number one son,
and they treated me like number
two. But it's human nature, to
fear the unusual ... even with all
their education and privilege ...
My dad, a district attorney, mother
active in the DAR ... Perhaps when
I held my Tiffany baby rattle with
a shiny flipper, and not five
chubby digits, they freaked.
(perfect beat)
But I forgive them.

Another ripple through the crowd, of pure love and
devotion.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--THAT EVENING

The Paperboy doesn't have enough tabloids to sell --
they're flying out of his hands. He quotes the banner
headline:

PAPERBOY
Penguin Forgives Parents ... "I'm
Fully At Peace With Myself and the
World ..."

All around him, charmed Gothamites read each other their
fave quotes from the cover story.

GOTHAMITE 1
"... You don't need hands, as long
as you've got heart ..."

GOTHAMITE 2
"... My heart is filled with love.
I feel five feet tall ..."

GOTHAMITE 3
He's like a frog, that became a
prince...

GOTHAMITE 4
No, he's more like a penguin...

We pick up the excahnge of a COUPLE, as they pass:

MAN
Abandoned penguins from the old
Arctic World raised him...

The WOMAN wipes a tear, squeezes his hand, and gushes:

WOMAN
Makes you remember the true
meaning of the holiday. The love,
the giving ...

Forget Christmas shopping ... It's a virtual sea of the
late-city edition. Hot-off-the-presses newspapers
everywhere ...

INT. BATCAVE LABORATORY--SAME TIME

Bruce Wayne is also reading a newspaper. But he's not
holding it and it's not today's issue ...

The newspaper is on microfiche, and it's projected on a
large screen before him. It's old, faded, yellowed ...
Bruce scans the articles and MURMURS, as he scrolls from
one to the next:

BRUCE
" ... Red Triangle Circus put on a
swell show last night, with fierce
lions ..."

He punches in a command, that appears on top of the
screen: CONTINUE SEARCH FOR: Red Triangle. A blur as
back issues whiz by, then another old article appears.

BRUCE
" ... Triangle Circus has returned
for a two-week ... Kids will love ..."

As he searches for the next reference (blurry screen
again), Alfred enters with supper, on a tray.

BRUCE
Thanks, Alfred.

He sips the soup.

BRUCE
It's cold.

ALFRED
It's vichyssoise, sir.

BRUCE
Vichyssoise.
(then)
Supposed to be cold, right?

He returns to his search through the file.

ALFRED
Mr. Wayne. Does the phrase
"Christmas holiday" hold any
resonance for you?

Bruce laughs. Then grabs an interactive CD on his table-
top and lobs it at Alfred like a frisbee.

BRUCE
Listen to yourself, Alfred. Hassling
me, yesterday, in my car.

Alfred dutifully pops the CD in a player, and hears his
own voice, recorded last night in the Batmobile.

ALFRED'S VOICE
What about eating? Sleeping? You
won't be much good to anyone else --

Bruce snaps it off.

BRUCE
I learned to live without a mother
a long time ago, thanks.

Tense, he turns back to the next article, onscreen.

BRUCE
" ... Circus is back, with a freak
show that may not be suitable for
your kids. Featuring a bearded
lady, the world's fattest man, and
an aquatic bird-boy."

He turns to Alfred: what do you make of that? Alfred
shrugs.

ALFRED
Why are you now determined to prove
that this Penguin -- er, Mr. Cobblepot
-- is not what he seems? Must you be
the only lonely "man-beast" in town?

But Bruce is already engrossed in the next article
onscreen.

BRUCE
"... Circus folded its tents
yesterday, perhaps forever. After
numerous reports of missing
children in several towns, police
have closed down the Red Triangle's
fairgrounds. However, at least
one freak show performer vanished
before he could be questioned."

Bruce turns back to Alfred, a strange "smoking-gun" smile
on his face.

ALFRED
I suppose you feel better now, sir.

BRUCE
No, actually I feel worse.

The two men, regard each other -- wordless, worried.
Finally:

ALFRED
Eat up your vichyssoise.

EXT. SHRECK BUILDING--THAT NIGHT

As we BOOM UP to the Executive Suite, we see Selina Kyle
at her desk in the outer office, slaving away.

INT. OUTER OFFICE--NIGHT

Selina makes notes. Now her pen nervously jerks as Max
oozes in, surprising her with a smarmy palm on her
shoulder.

MAX
Working late? I'm touched.

SELINA
(under her breath)
No, I am.
(then, officious)
Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce
Wayne meeting in the morning. I
pulled all the files on the
proposed power plant, and Mr.
Wayne's hoped-for investment...
I've studied up on all of it ...
I even opened the protected files
and --

Max looks surprised.

MAX
Why, how industrious. And how did
you open protected files, may I
ask?

SELINA
Well I figured that your password
was "Finster." Your Pomeranian.
And it was. And it's all very
interesting, though a bit on the
technical side, I mean about how the
power plant is a power plant in
name only since in fact it's
gonna be one big giant...

Max encourangingly nods: go on. She consults her notes.

SELINA
Big giant capacitor. And that,
instead of generating power it'll
sort of be --
(checks notes again)
-- sucking power, from Gotham City,
and storing it ... stockpiling it,
sort of? Which, unless I'm being
dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.

MAX
And who ... would you say this to?

Selina is suddenly a tad less certain of her position, as
Max lights a match, and sets her notepad afire. She
swallows.

SELINA
Well ... um ... nobody --?

Max drops the charred notepad and moves toward her.

MAX
... Where did curiosity get the cat?

SELINA
I'm no cat. I'm just an assistant.
A secretary --

MAX
And a very, very good one.

SELINA
(a guess)
Too good?

Max nods: You got it, babycakes. Selina backs away.

SELINA
It's our secret. Honest. How can
you be so mean to someone so
meaningless?

MAX
I must protect my interests, Ms.
Kyle. And Interest Number One, is
moi.

Selina is up against the window now, her back to the
pane.

SELINA
(burst of bravado)
Okay, go ahead. Intimidate me, bully
me if it makes you feel big. I mean,
it's not like you can just kill me.

MAX
(almost pitying)
Actually, it's a lot like that.

Tense silence. Then Max smiles. Selina wipes away a
tear.

SELINA
For a second, you really frightened --

Max savagely pushes Selina through the window.

EXT. SHRECK ALLEY--NIGHT

Selina swirls downward through shattering glass and snow-
flakes with tragic beauty.

Her fall is (luckily) slowed by a protruding flagpole
with the smiling Shreck cat logo on its flapping flag.
Then she (luckily) lands in a deep snowdrift.

Her eyes creak open, fuzzily focusing on the happy cat above.

SELINA
(faintly)
Help me ... someone ... Miss Kitty ...

INT. SHRECK CONFERENCE ROOM--NIGHT

Max turns away from the window, stunned by his own
violence. Even more stunned, when he sees:

Chip, who's been standing in the doorway.

MAX
I ... it was terrible, I leaned
over, and accidentally knocked
her, out --

CHIP
(cool)
She jumped. She'd been depressed.

MAX
(beat, then nods)
Yes. Yes. Boyfriend trouble ..?

CHIP
(shakes his head)
PMS.

He turns and walks out. Max watches his son go, seeing
him in an entirely new light.

EXT. SHRECK ALLEY--NIGHT

Miss Kitty, summoned by her desperate owner, now appears
... leading cats of every shape, color and demeanor from
every direction. Selina's cat crawls up onto Selina's
blouse and begins to breathe into her mouth in an eerie
feline C.P.R. ballet.

A Siamese whispers in Selina's ear, aw-so-cute Tabbies
snuggle against the soles of her feet. A scraggly Tom
viciously bites her finger. Selina's eyes fly open.

INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT--STILL LATER THAT NIGHT

Battered, bloodied, and clutching Miss Kitty, Selina
re-enters her apartment. She is the malevolent antidote
to her poignantly pleasant previous self. She stares in
unmoving, but torrid self-contemplation. Then she
explodes into vivid montage:

With a black spray paint can in each hand, Selina attacks
everything pink and eggshell--carpet, couch, wallpaper.

With uncoiled wire coat-hangers, she sets about trans-
forming her Murphy bed into something weird and painful.

She flings her childhood picture off the wall into a
mini-bonfire (that includes her sad Christmas tree) set
up on her kitchen-nook table.

She lustily shoves a stuffed unicorn into her garbage
disposal. The carnage of other ex-cute toy creatures
are spread about.

Miss Kitty races about, purring in delight.

With a sewing needle, Selina repeatedly stabs her doll's
house, annihilating the micro-detailed rooms. In close-up,
the rooms seem to be invaded by a giant silver missile.

Next, with the same needle, we see her stitching together
something slinky, stretchy and black.

Then she assaults her feel-good neon sign. With bare
fists, she punches out the last letter of the first word
and the first letter of the second, turning "HELLO THERE!
into "HELL HERE!"

INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT--THE NEXT MORNING--DAY

As the sun rises through the windows, Selina sits in a
lotus position on the floor of her very redone apartment.
She is wearing her sinful black hand-sewn cat-suit. She
slides a pristine bowl of milk to her content cat and
speaks in a sultry voice. Her Catwoman voice.

SELINA
I don't know about you, Miss
Kitty, but I feel. So. Much.
Yummier.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--MORNING--DAY

MECHANICS hustle about the tree, trying to fix it.

Bruce Wayne gazes at this hapless exercise, then moves
past the torched Bat merchandising toward the Shreck
building.

INT. THE OUTER OFFICE--DAY

Max and Chip stare, expressionless, out the shattered
office window. Snow has wisped into the office.

MAX
... I hope nothing--I don't know,
"icky" happened to her. Devoured
by stray reindeer, or ... Bruce.

Bruce Wayne has just entered. As he shakes with Max, his
eyes drift to the window.

BRUCE
Hmm. Primitive ventilation.

MAX
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the
other night, throwing bricks at
my windows --

BRUCE
No. No glass on the inside.

MAX
(fidgets)
Weird, huh?

INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

Bruce sits at the circular conference table. Max paces.

MAX
I'd offer you coffee, but my
assistant is using her vacation time.

BRUCE
Good time, too.
(pointedly)
Everyone but the bandits seem to be
slacking off till after New Years'.

Max aggressively sits knee to knee with Bruce.

MAX
Not sure I like the inference,
Bruce. I'm pushing this power
plant now only because it'll cost
more, later. And a million saved
is a million earned --

Bruce SNAPS open his briefcase, pulls out a bound report.

BRUCE
I commissioned this report.
Thought you should see it.

Ostentatiously bored, Max flips through the thing.

BRUCE
I'll cut to the chase, Max:
Gotham City has a power surplus.
I'm sure you know that. So the
question is: what're you up to?

Max jumps to his feet.

MAX
"A power surplus"!? Bruce, shame
on you -- no such thing! One can
never have too much power.

Chip, standing tall beside his dad, vehemently nods.

MAX
(pious)
If my life has had any meaning,
that's the meaning.

BRUCE
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this.
The Mayor and I have already spoken
and we see eye to eye here. So --

MAX
Mayors come and go. And heirs
tire easily. Really think a
flyweight like you could last
fifteen rounds with Muhammed
Shreck.

BRUCE
I'm not scared of you, Max.

He shuts his briefcase and stands.

BRUCE
Not compared to that "Cobblepot"
person you're promoting...

MAX
(derides)
Scared of Oswald, are you? Why,
if his parents hadn't eighty-
sixed him you two might've been
roomies, at prep school!

BRUCE
"Oswald" is linked to the Red
Triangle Gang. I can't prove it
but we both know it's true.

MAX
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud-
slinging in this office. If my
assistant were here, she'd already
have escorted you out, to --

WOMAN'S VOICE, OS
-- wherever he wants.

Bruce, Max and Chip all turn, to see:

Selina, as she sashays in. Assertively dressed and
coiffed, hand bandaged but head held high.

SELINA
Preferably some nightspot, grotto,
or secluded hideaway ...
(to Bruce)
You look good in a suit.

Recognizing her as the spirited woman he'd stared at in
the plaza, Bruce gives her a warm smile.

MAX
(stunned)
Selina?! Selina ... Selina ...

SELINA
That's my name, Maximillions.
Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll
make you buy me a new one.

MAX
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce
Wayne.

BRUCE
We've met.

SELINA
Have we?

Bruce realizes his "error."

BRUCE
Sorry. I mistook me for somebody
else.

SELINA
You mean mistook me?

BRUCE
Didn't I say that?

SELINA
(amused)
Yes and no ...

Bruce steps forward. Gently takes her bandaged hand.

BRUCE
What happened?

MAX
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself
on that ski slope? Is that why
you cut short your vacation and
came back?

His steely smile says: answer "yes" or else. Selina
shrugs.

SELINA
Maybe that broken window over there
had something to do with it, or
maybe not, it's blurry ... I mean,
not complete amnesia ... I remember
Sister Mary-Margaret puking in
Church, and Becky Riley said it was
morning sickness.
And I remember the time I forgot
to wear underpants to school, and
the name of the boy who noticed
... Ricky Friedburg, he's dead
now ... But last night? Complete
and total blur.

Max trades looks with Chip. Then:

MAX
Selina... Please show out Mr. Wayne.

INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY

Selina sees Bruce to the elevator. They scope each
other ...

SELINA
You don't seem like the type who
does business with Mr. Shreck.

BRUCE
No. And you don't seem like the
type who takes orders from him.

SELINA
Well that's a ... long story ...

BRUCE
Well, I could ... free up some
time...

SELINA
I'm listed.

BRUCE
I'm tempted.

Selina backs toward the conference room.

SELINA
I'm working.

Bruce backs into the corridor.

BRUCE
I'm leaving.

INT. CORRIDOR--DAY

Bruce punches the down button to punctuate the syllables:

BRUCE
Se-li-na.

The car arrives. He gets in. Suddenly remembers some-
thing. Fights the closing doors, dashes out!

INT. OUTER OFFICE--SAME TIME

Selina stops to spitefully squeeze a few drops of blood
from her injured fingertip into the percolating coffee.

Suddenly she looks up, realizing that Bruce is standing
here. Embarrassed, she jokes:

SELINA
Pouring myself into my work.

BRUCE
(smiles, then)
I, ah ... didn't catch your last
name.

SELINA
Oh. "Kyle."

She mimes making a telephone call.

SELINA
Rhymes with "dial."

Bruce signals: gotcha. Then backs out.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM--SAME TIME

As a brooding Max dials out:

CHIP
You buy this "blurry" business?

MAX
(shrugs)
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip.
Excepting your late mother... Who
even knew Selina had a brain to
damage? Bottom line: she tries
to blackmail us, we drop her out
a higher window. Meanwhile I got
badder fish to fry.
(into phone)
Yeah -- Oswald, please.

INT. STOREFRONT OFFICE BUILDING (CAMPAIGN H.Q.)--DAY

A two-story warehouse space with a particularly funky top
floor. A dozen Red Triangle Carny Creeps rough-house on
the filthy loft floor. Others crawl in and out, through
a vent.

Penguin is sitting by an open window, enjoying the brisk
winter air as he reviews his stack of legal pads, cross-
referencing them against a Gotham City White Pages ...
and scribbling down addresses, next to the boys' names ...

The Organ Grinder lofts the phone to Penguin.

ORGAN GRINDER
For you, boss.

PENGUIN
Yeah, what is it? I'm busy up
here?

INT. SHRECK CONFERENCE ROOM--SAME TIME

Max smiles.

MAX
Good. Stay busy up there.

INT. STOREFRONT OFFICE BLDG.--SAME TIME

As Max continues, VO, we slowly BOOM DOWN to the GROUND
FLOOR. A far shinier, spiffier, classier, freshly-
painted space ...

MAX'S VOICE
I got plans for us, below.

A lone Volunteer tapes red, white and blue bunting around
the perimeter of the room. Bunting never looked so ominous.

QUICKLY BOOM BACK UP to the funky top floor.

PENGUIN
(distracted)
"Plans." Swell. Later.

He slams down the receiver. Then goes back to the phone
book, and his list ...

EXT. ANOTHER ALLEY--NIGHT

where a relatively normal-looking MUGGER slaps his hand
over a FEMALE VICTIM's mouth and rummages into her purse.

FEMALE VICTIM
Help Bat--

MUGGER
Now-now, pretty young thing, nice
and easy...

FEMALE VICTIM
Please, don't hurt me, I'll do
anything...

Suddenly the mugger squeals in pain -- his hand is
yanked out of the purse by a stinging whip that's
wrapped around his wrist.

With a screech, Catwoman suddenly lands around the
mugger's neck, twisting him down in a brutal tackle.

CATWOMAN
I just love a big strong man who's
not afraid to show it, with
someone half his size.

MUGGER
Who the...

Catwoman smiles politely, and puts away her whip.

CATWOMAN
Be gentle, it's my first time.

The Mugger charges up at Catwoman, who savagely Rockettes
him back, gasping with fixed-the-toaster-by-myself delight.
Then a flurry of talon scratches across his face that sends
him squealing to the asphalt.

CATWOMAN
Tic....Tac....Toe.

FEMALE VICTIM
(rushing up)
Thank you, thank you, I was so
scared...

Catwoman swats the Female Victim back against a wall.

CATWOMAN
You make it so easy, don't you --
you pretty, pathetic young thing?
Always waiting for some Batman to
save you.

The Female Victim is quaking, mouth twitching in fear ...
As Catwoman leans forward, Victim cringes, expecting the
worst. But Catwoman throatily whispers into the Female
Victim's ear:

CATWOMAN
"I'm Catwoman, hear me roar."

Then gaily cartwheels out of the alley, into the night.

INT. STOREFRONT OFFICE BLDG. (CAMPAIGN H.Q.)--NEXT DAY

The Strongman pumps iron, rippling the bellydancers
tattooed on his biceps. An acrobat walks on his hands
across the filthy floor, past ...

Max, walking Penguin down the stairs, one hand over his
protegee's slitted eyes.

MAX
Don't look, Oswald. It's a
surprise.

PENGUIN
A big bag of fan mail? Filthy
lucre? Wait don't tell me ... Is
it a broad?

We follow them down to the spiffy ground floor storefront.

INT. CAMPAIGN H.Q.--DAY

Max lifts his palm off Penguin's puss.

MAX
Ta-da.

Penguin's eyes pop. We reveal the storefront (the window
is draped for secrecy) as Cobblepot For Mayor campaign
headquarters! Bunting, balloons, posters proclaiming Ozzie
vs. the Insiders, desks, MacIntoshes, and fresh-scrubbed
college-kid Volunteers.

Who now burst into CHEERS and APPLAUSE for a speechless
Penguin. Under all that ruckus.

PENGUIN
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...

MAX
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know. But someone's
got to supplant our standing-in-
the-way-of-progress Mayor and
don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've
got the magic!

PENGUIN
Max, elections happen in November.
Is this not late December, or have
I inhaled too much swamp gas in my
time?

Suddenly, a stylish, slick and instantly loathsome pair pop
out of nowhere, bedecked with accessories -- JOSH and JEN.

JOSH
Keep the umbrella! Works for you!
I'm Josh. Here! Reclaim your
birthright!

He sticks a gold cigarette holder in Penguin's mouth. As
they flutter around him, Penguin instinctively fidgets.

JEN
I'm Jen. Stand still while I slip
on these little glove-thingies ...

She's tugging cute stuffed Mickey Mouse-y gloves over the
Penguin's fingers, and trying to suppress her gag reflex.

JEN
Our research tells us that voters
like fingers.

Josh, meantime, queasily fingers Penguin's tattered
clothes. Then flashes a "we've got a ways to go"
grimace, at Max.

JOSH
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
down in that sewer, huh?

Jen chuckles. Penguin joins in the laughter. The
Volunteers laugh, too.

PENGUIN
Still, could be worse. My nose
could be gushing blood.

JOSH
(frankly confused)
Your nose could ... what do you ...

Penguin suddenly -- viciously -- chomps on Josh's cute
snout. The Volunteers GASP.

MAX
Enough! Everyone ...

While Josh faints, in b.g., Max leads Penguin away to a
quiet corner. And confides:

MAX
You're right, we missed the
regularly scheduled election. But
elected officials can be recalled,
impeached, given the boot! Think
of Nixon, Meacham, Barry ... Then
think of you, Oswald Cobblepot,
filling the void.

Penguin nods. He's thinking about something quite like
that.

PENGUIN
Me and that "Jen" chick... maybe
we could take a tumble...

He furtively glances over at Jen, swabbing Josh's blood.

PENGUIN
Wonder if it's worth my time.

MAX
We need signatures. To overturn the
ballot. I can supply those, Oswald.

PENGUIN
I could teach her my "French
flipper" trick...

MAX
Oswald: We need one more thing.

PENGUIN
(snapping out of it)
A platform? Lemme see ... Stop
global warming. Start global
cooling. Make the world a colder
place. Frigid ...

MAX
That's fine, Oswald. But to get
the Mayor recalled, we still need
a catalyst, a trigger, an incident.
Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf
of Tonkin.

PENGUIN
"You're doin' great, Mayor
Cobblepot." "Your table is ready,
Mayor Cobblepot." "I need you,
Oswald. I need you now. That's
the biggest parasol I ever --"

Suddenly Max's words sink in. Penguin points at the ceiling.

PENGUIN
Ah. You want those lawless,
mindless, homicidal imbeciles up
there ... you want my old friends
... want them to humiliate the
powers that be. Drive the Mayor
into a foaming frenzy. You want
my hideous cohorts to go haywire.

Max smiles.

MAX
Precisely. But they must come and
go via the plumbing ducts that I've
provided. That shall be as sacred
as the separation between church
and state.

PENGUIN
... Want 'em to go apeshit. Nutso.
Ballistic ... Do permanent damage
to little old ladies. Loot, pillage,
annoy people in a big way ...
(muses)
Sounds fun. But I ...

Max looks at him: but you what? An evil shadow falls
over Penguin's face. We DRIFT IN on his slitted eyes, as:

PENGUIN
I got my own ... quest to pursue
up here. It's crucial I not get
sidetracked, with some silly ...

MAX
Sidetracked? Oswald, this is
your chance to fulfill a destiny
that your parents carelessly
discarded ...

PENGUIN
(puffing up)
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?

MAX
(nods)
Imagine: You'll have the ear of
the media. Access to captains
of industry. Unlimited poon-
tang ...

Penguin quickly decides.

PENGUIN
I wanna be the Mayor. I wanna be
the Mayor of Gotham City ...

Then looks out at the city. And makes a benediction:

PENGUIN
Burn, baby, burn.

EXT. ANOTHER GOTHAM STREET--NIGHT

Wearing protective goggles, the ORGAN GRINDER twists out
some music as his monkeys dance. Then nges down on
his Organ Box causing an Insta-Teller machine to explode.
His monkeys hop up to snatch flaming cash.

ORGAN GRINDER
All this dough... it's burning a
hole in my pocket!

INT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS--NIGHT

Upstairs. Penguin stands by the open window, watching
the destruction, his face lit by the flames outside as
he HEARS updates from a fat Clown, his ear against a
radio.

FAT CLOWN
The Ice Rink was torched!
(then)
The 12th Precinct reports
offensive graffiti and a pharmacy
heist!

Penguin makes a fist, with phony fingers.

PENGUIN
Love to get my flippers dirty.
Bust someone's skull. Eat someone's
pet ...
(then, a statesman)
But action must be balanced with
discretion ...

He moves back to his desk. Resumes writing.

As we MOVE IN on Penguin, we reveal that he's adding new
addresses, to his mysterious list...

INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT--NIGHT

Selina looks out almost longingly at the unfolding
apocalypse below. Suddenly Miss Kitty leaps onto the sill
and then out the open window. Inspired, Selina jumps up
and goes for her Catwoman garb. As she effects a quick
change:

SELINA
An orgy of sex and violence? Count
me in, Miss Kitty.

She crawls cat-like through the narrow gap, onto the ledge.

SELINA
It's the purr-fect cover, for
the purr-fect crime.

EXT. ANOTHER GOTHAM STREET--NIGHT

The Knifethrower Dame axes down a store door. Other
gang members pound DEFENSELESS VICTIMS. All suddenly
turn TO CAMERA -- to Batman.

Batman reaches into his bat-belt and pulls out what looks
like a sleek black Gameboy. As if bored on a plane,
batman casually punches in a set of white dots and one
red one. The Knifethrower Dame rockets a blade into his
Bat-chest plate. Batman keeps punching in dots.

With a simultaneous howl, the band of thugs charge at
Batman from every direction. Batman presses a button on
his Gameboy that causes batarang arms to sprout out.
Batman heaves the super-batarang.

The super-batarang whizzes with wild concentration, pin-
balling from Creep skull to Creep skull, slamming them
all, including a lunging gang member behind Batman, to
the ground.

But now, as it wobbles back to Batman, the Ratty Poodle
leaps up and snatches the batarang in his rotten teeth.
The Poodle, led by the Poodle Lady, scurries off.

Before Batman can give chase, the Raggedy Sword-Swallower
leaps out at him. Batman gives him a strategic elbow to
the ribs and pulls the sword from his mouth. A Thin
Clown with a bomb strapped to his chest pops out next.

THIN CLOWN
I'll blow up this whole --

Batman lashes out with the sword and shears the bomb from
the Thin Clown's chest.

Batman catches the bomb, then slams the Clown to the
ground with the back of the sword. Flinging away the
sword, Batman goes searching for his super-batarang.

EXT. SHRECK'S DEPARTMENT STORE--NIGHT

Catwoman saunters up to the door of a closed Shreck's
department store and punctures the Shreck Kitten logo on
the glass, with her talons.

INT. DARKENED DEPARTMENT STORE--NIGHT

Catwoman dashes down an aisle, shredding the priceless
blouses of a gauntlet of pouting mannequins. She twists
up the volume on a stereo, blasting cool jazz. She
stamps atop a jewelry case in a girlish tantrum.

CATWOMAN
Oh, for me? You shouldn't have...

At the sound of shattering, a PAIR OF SECURITY GUARDS
round a corner to see Catwoman now merrily bouncing on
a trampoline in Physical Fitness.

From Catwoman's rising and falling POV, the Security Men
gasp up.

SECURITY ONE
Who is she? What is she?

SECURITY TWO
I don't know whether to shoot or
fall in love.

CATWOMAN
You poor guys ... always confusing
your pistols with your privates ...

The Guards have unholstered. Before they can fire,
Catwoman swooshes down, thrashing them to the ground.
Then cartwheels to a wall tile that she bashes open,
revealing a propane tank behind it. She talons off a
hose, letting gas hiss away ...

GUARD 1
Don't hurt us! Our take-home is
under three-hundred.

CATWOMAN
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

The Guards have already taken off running as Catwoman
skips over to Car-Care, gathers up a handful of aerosol
cans ... then saunters down to Today's Kitchen, and shoves
the cans into a row of microwave ovens. Giddily BEEPS
them all ON.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--NIGHT

The Tattooed Strongman swaggers out from a patch of smoke
behind Batman and looses a savage kidney punch. Batman
painfully reels forward, keeping balance.

TATTOOED STRONGMAN
Before I kill you, I let you hit
me. Hit me. Come on, hit as hard
as you can. I need a good laugh.

Batman punches the Strongman's stomach. The Tattooed
leviathan roars with laughter.

TATTOOED STRONGMAN
You call that a...

The Tattooed Strongman stops laughing when he looks down
and sees that Batman has attached the Thin Clown's bomb
to the Not-so-Strongman's leopard skin. Batman gives him
a calm, firm push into an open manhole.

An explosion geysers out of it. Batman turns from the
blast at the precise moment Penguin meanders out of the
darkness, casually shaking debris off his umbrella. They
stop dead at the sight of each other.

BATMAN
Admiring your handiwork?

PENGUIN
Touring the riot scene. Gravely
assessing the devastation.
Upstanding mayor stuff.

BATMAN
You're not the Mayor.

PENGUIN
(shrugs)
Things change.
(sticks out a
glove)
Hey, good to meet you. We'll be
working hand in glove in Gotham's
glorious future.

Batman doesn't shake. Instead he gestures at the plumes
of smoke all around the plaza.

BATMAN
Once you were their freak, now
these clowns do your bidding.
Must feel pretty good.

PENGUIN
Better than you know, Bat-boy.

BATMAN
What're you really after?

PENGUIN
Ah, the direct approach. I admire
that in a man with a mask. But
you don't really think you'll ever
win, playing it your way ..?

BATMAN
(cold smile)
Things change.

Penguin is fashioning a retort, when both men suddenly
turn, mesmerized, to the sight of Catwoman coming toward
them from out of Shreck's department store, startling
back flip by startling back flip. She does a final
somersault and lands on her feet, ten yards away.

CATWOMAN
(dry enunciation)
Meow.

The department store behind her goes up with a glowing
roar. Batman and Penguin are knocked back. Both men
quickly regain their balance. But neither can speak,
right away. Presently:

PENGUIN
I saw her first.
(then, opens
umbrella)
Gotta fly.

The steel rods of Penguin's umbrella spin out of control,
shredding off the black cloth and turning into a mini-
helicopter that lifts Penguin off the ground.

Meantime Batman catches sight of Catwoman scaling the
ridges of a Plaza building.

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP--NIGHT

Batman storms up the last of the fire escape and passes
Catwoman, curled atop a rooftop power shack. When she
speaks, Batman turns to see her slink down. Disarming
patches of flesh are revealed all over her battle-ripped
outfit.

CATWOMAN
Where's the fire?

BATMAN
"Shreck's." You --

Catwoman launches a brutal kick in Batman's face. Batman
vibrates back a few steps, then comes forward and slams
Catwoman into a whimpering ball. She looks up, shocked.

CATWOMAN
How could you? I'm a woman...

BATMAN
(suddenly taken
aback)
I'm -- sorry, I --

Catwoman spins, pounding Batman off the ledge. Then
lashes out her whip, coiling it around Batman's flapping
arm. With both hands, she jerks him up. Lashes her end
of the whip to a weather vane.

CATWOMAN
As I was saying: I'm a woman, and
can't be taken for granted. Are
you listening, you Batman you?

BATMAN
(grimaces)
Hanging on every word.

CATWOMAN
Good joke. Wanna hear another one?

Batman nods: Lay it on me.

CATWOMAN
The world tells boys to conquer the
world, and girls to wear clean
panties. A man dressed as a bat
is a he-man, but a woman dressed
as a cat is a she-devil. I'm just
living down to my expectations.
Life's a bitch -- now so am I.

She runs her talons over the whip-lifeline. Meantime
with his free arm, Batman reaches into his bat belt and
pulls out a plastic mini-test tube with a blue fluid on
top, red fluid on the bottom, separated by a thin barrier.

BATMAN
A "he-man"? Sure. They shine
that beacon in the sky, then wonder
what hole I crawl out of.

CATWOMAN
Wow, a real response and you're
not even trying to get into my tights.
But explain me ... If you're
so down on "them" out there, why
bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?

BATMAN
I just can't sleep at night.
Exploding department stores keep
me up. One ...

He snaps the tube. As the blue seeps into the red and
the tube slowly glows purple ...

CATWOMAN
I can't sleep either, lately. A
little link, between us. But
bottom line baby, you live to
preserve the peace, and I'm dying
to disturb it. That could put a
strain on our relationship.

BATMAN
...four, five.

He lobs the now-bubbling tube as Catwoman starts to sever
the whip. The mixture explodes against her forearm. She
SHRIEKS like a dying cat and soars down onto the next
ledge, barely.

Batman leaps down, to her. Her talons frantically claw
and scratch as she tries not to plummet. Batman grabs
her, pulls her up -- for a moment, they're embracing.

CATWOMAN
Who are you? Who's the man behind
the bat? Maybe he can help me
find the woman behind the Cat.
(pressing armor)
That's not him ... Ah, here you
are ...

Her talons poise at the edge of Batman's armor, just above
the waist. Suddenly Catwoman thrusts. Batman ROARS with
pain and fiercely swats Catwoman away -- off the building!

BATMAN
-- No --

He watches in shock as her body hurtles toward the ground.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET--NIGHT

But at the last minute, from out of nowhere, a dumptruck
filled with sand passes, and Catwoman lands in a soft dune.

EXT. TRUCK (MOVING)--NIGHT

As the truck motors off, Catwoman waves a paw up at
Batman. Then murmurs, as she cozily rolls around in the
sand:

CATWOMAN
Saved by kitty-litter. Some
date ...

Then, lit by a streetlamp, she tears up her sleeve to
study the nasty injury Batman dealt her.

CATWOMAN
So it's not a corsage. But a
burn lasts so much longer. The
bastard.

INT. THE BAT CAVE--NIGHT--LATER

Batman, disrobing, checks the puncture wounds on his
stomach.

BATMAN
The bitch.

Then he buzzes for his butler.

BATMAN
Alfred ... Would you bring me some
antiseptic ointment, please?

ALFRED'S VOICE
Coming ... Are you hurt?

BATMAN
My ego, mostly.

He signs off. Then lightly rubs the wound ... and
murmurs:

BATMAN
... Meow.

INT. SHRECK OUTER OFFICE--NEXT DAY

Selina sits at her desk. The old Post-its are now
replaced. The new ones read "Defy Authority," "Take No
Prisoners" and "Expose The Horror." A buzzing fly
distracts her as she works ... without looking up, her
hand nails the little pest with feline precision. With
her other hand she grabs a carton of lowfat milk. Then
impatiently stands ...

INT. SHRECK CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

Selina saunters in, with coffee. Chip, seeing her, sits
up ramrod-straight.

SELINA
Morning, Max. Bummer about the
store. You insured?

MAX
I damn well better be. In fact I
want you to phone those goniffs
over at Gotham Insurance and tell
them --

SELINA
Actually I have to split. Take
a "personal day." You don't mind?
Max, you're tops.

Max nods -- sure, sure -- then sips his coffee. And
spits a live cockroach from his mouth!

Both Max and Chip GAG as it crawls across the table.

SELINA
Those darned exterminators. They
swore the machine was ship-shape.

With that she turns, and saunters out.

EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS--NOON

After last night's rampage, the curtain has come off the
window, revealing the storefront as the nucleus of a new
political movement. Twin banners read: "Oswald Means
Order" and "Cobblepot Can Clean It Up."

INT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS--NOON

The room is crowded with Press and Volunteers, who
surround Penguin (cooled by a fan) as he pontificates ...

PENGUIN
I may have saved the Mayor's baby,
but I refuse to save a Mayor who
stood by, helpless as a baby,
while a band of hooligans flushed
our fair city down the tubes of
debauchery, devastation --

ANGLE--AGGRESSIVE REPORTER

One one of the pay phones in back. Other reporters call
in stories to their editors as Penguin RAGES in b.g.

AGGRESSIVE REPORTER
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery
man-beast who's been delighting
Gotham, today made his bid to
deliver Gotham ... from ruffians
who've run riot, and from a Mayor
he's called "impotent, inept ..."

BACK TO PENGUIN

As he concludes his exhortation to the throng:

PENGUIN
... inept, indecisive, and ... and
too tall. We don't need a tall
man to run this town. The bigger
they are, the harder they fall.
We need a ... compact man who carries
a big umbrella. Thank you, all.

Puffing from the APPLAUSE, he heads for the stairs and
passes an adoring young Volunteer Bimbo.

VOLUNTEER BIMBO
Mr. Cobblepot, you're the coolest
role model a young person could have ...

PENGUIN
(raw lust)
And you're the hottest young person
a role model could have. Here,
wear a button.

Penguin fondles and fumbles a campaign button onto the
pert breast of the starry-eyed Bimbo.

Then, as he struts upstairs:

PENGUIN
I could really get into this Mayor
stuff. It's not about power, it's
about ... reaching people.
Touching people. Groping people ...

INT. CAMPAIGN H.Q. UPPER STORY--AFTERNOON

In sordid contrast to the gleaming h.q. below. The
Organ Grinder supervises construction of various arcane
weaponry. As Penguin enters, the Fat Clown pops in his
face.

FAT CLOWN
Hey Penguin, there's a --

Penguin savagely stomps on the Clown's oversized shoe.

PENGUIN
My name's not Penguin! It's
Oswald Cobblepot!

He continues on, still musing:

PENGUIN
Hell, maybe I'll get laid on the
campaign trail ... Happy Trails ...

The KNIFETHROWER DAME blocks his path.

KNIFETHROWER DAME
Oswald ... someone here to see
you.

She nods at Penguin's bed, in the corner. He lights up
as he sees Catwoman, sexily curled up on the mattress.
(Hanging above is a birdcage, where Penguin's filthy
CANARY intermittently SHRIEKS.)

PENGUIN
(throaty squawk)
Just the pussy I been looking for.

Catwoman sits up, languidly stroking her shoulders.

CATWOMAN
Chilly in here.

In fact there are twin air conditioners, on adjacent
walls, both aimed at the bed and going full blast.

PENGUIN
I'll warm ya! I got hot mitts --!

CATWOMAN
Down, Oswald. We have to talk. You
see we've got something in common.

PENGUIN
Appetite for destruction?
Contempt for the czars of fashion?
Wait don't tell me ... Naked
sexual charisma?

CATWOMAN
Batman. The thorn in both our
sides, the fly in our ointment.

PENGUIN
(cagey)
Huh? You're implying I'm some
kinda psycho criminal?

Catwoman ironically takes in the sociopathic chaos. Then
stands.

CATWOMAN
My mistake.

Penguin sits her back down.

PENGUIN
Are you perchance a registered
voter? I'm also a mayoral
prospect.

CATWOMAN
I have but one pet cause, today:
Ban The Bat.

PENGUIN
Oh, him again. He's already
history -- check it out.

Penguin gestures at the wall ... detailed drawings and
blueprints of the Batmobile, inside and out.

PENGUIN
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy
old Batmobile, then reassemble it
as an H-bomb on wheels. Capiche?
Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's
vapor.

CATWOMAN
(shakes her head)
He'd have more power as a martyr.
No, to destroy Batman we must
first turn him into what he hates
most. Meaning, us.

There's an array of closed umbrellas, propped. Penguin
picks a disturbingly phallic one, strokes Catwoman's
thigh with it.

PENGUIN
Y'mean frame him?

CATWOMAN
You're quick. Mayor Cobblepot.

As the umbrealls-dildo travels up, toward Catwoman's
crotch:

PENGUIN
Right on! Batman goes Manson, and
the Mayor goes South. Straight
into the sewer. Actually it's not
so bad down there, I miss the
drip, drip, drip ...

Meanwhile Catwoman has noticed, on Penguin's night-table,
the tall stack of legal pads filled with names.

CATWOMAN
Hmm ... Not even in office yet,
and already an enemies list ..?

Attempted seduction forgotten, Penguin springs up,
scurries over and covers the stack with his gloves.

PENGUIN
Those names are not for prying eyes!

And suddenly it hits him:

PENGUIN
Hey, why should I trust some
Catbroad? This is the big-time.
Are you the real item? Maybe you're
just some screwed-up sorority chick
who's getting back at Daddy for not
buying her that pony when she
turned sweet sixteen ...

Catwoman gulps, nervous -- then retaliates by shooting
her paw into the birdcage. She pulls out the canary and
shoves it into her mouth. Penguin leaps up, frantic.

PENGUIN
No, don't hurt Gertrude! I was
just -- whattaya call it --
"flirting."

Catwoman coolly spits out the canary, which flutters off.

PENGUIN
Thanks. Jeez. Not used to this
man-woman, cat-mouse business.
Generally the babes flock to me,
I tell 'em take a number.

CATWOMAN
You're off the hook, Ozzie. But
Batman is decidedly not.

She drifts over to Penguin and starts to vamp him,
gliding her talons over his grotesque, sweating features.

CATWOMAN
(sultry skulking)
He napalmed my arm. He knocked me
off a building just when I was
starting to feel good about myself.
I want to play an integral part
in his degradation.

PENGUIN
(tentative)
Well, a plan is forming ... A
vicious one, involving the loss
of innocent life ...

CATWOMAN
I want in. The thought of busting
Batman makes me feel all ...
dirty. Maybe I'll give myself a
bath right here ...

Catwoman slyly licks an arm. Penguin grossly licks his
lips.

PENGUIN
You just got yourself a deal,
Cat-doll.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR--THAT NIGHT

Through the window, we see the sparkling Christmas tree.
And we HEAR, wafting from the TV set:

PENGUIN'S VOICE
I challenge the Mayor to re-light
the tree in Gotham Plaza, tommorow
night.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM--NIGHT

Alfred serves Bruce his supper, as Bruce impassively
watches "Oswald Cobblepot" at campaign headquarters, on
local news.

PENGUIN
(on TV)
He must prove that under his
administration, we can carry on
our proud traditions without fear.
Not that I have any faith in the
Mayor... but I pray, at least,
that Batman will be there, to
preserve the peace.

Alfred notices his boss quietly seething.

ALFRED
Sir. Shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and
class? "The Love Connection,"
perhaps?

Bruce quietly tells the preening image on the screen:

BRUCE
You're very subtle, "Oswald."

Then moodily clicks OFF the TV.

EXT. THE SHOPS OF GOTHAM PLAZA--DAY

NAIVELY GIDDY CHILDREN and GUARDEDLY AMUSED PARENTS
browse a damaged but not defeated line of Plaza shops.
Father, Mother, and Boy--A FAMILY HIGHLY REMINISCENT OF
YOUNG BRUCE WAYNE AND HIS DOOMED PARENTS--drift to a
magically intact toy store window.

Bruce Wayne sidles up beside them and sadly contemplates
the cozy menage. He turns and looks, not through the
window, but at it, at the reflection of himself.

In the corner of the window reflection is a reflection of
Selina Kyle standing across the street. Her back turned,
she is also looking toward a store window. Noticing her,
Bruce turns from his window.

EXT. THE STORE ACROSS THE STREET--DAY

Selina grimly stares at her reflection. And asks
herself:

SELINA
Why are you doing this?

Bruce touches her shoulder, startling her.

BRUCE
Selina. Hi. Didn't mean to --

SELINA
Scare me? No, actually, I was
just scaring myself ...

BRUCE
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's
a treat to find you out in the
world, away from Ebeneezer
Shreck.

SELINA
(halfhearted)
Treat to be here.

They begin to stroll, together.

BRUCE
What's the story? Holiday blues?

Selina nods at a newsstand as they pass it: blazing
headlines that read "BATMAN BLOWS IT," "IT'S A CAT-
ASTROPHE" and "MEE-OUCH!"

SELINA
The news these days ... weird.
People looking to superheroes for
their peace of mind, and blaming
their problems on super-villains
... instead of themselves, or
their spouses at least.

BRUCE
And it's not even accurate ... I
mean, "Batman Blows It"? The guy
probably prevented millions in
property damage.

SELINA
(nodding)
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought
to weigh 140 pounds." How do
these hacks sleep at night?

In b.g., Police cordon off the Plaza. Workers hoist
signs that read "The Relighting of the Tree, Tonight at
Seven!"

SELINA
You're not coming to that, are
you? "The Relighting of the Tree"
thing?

BRUCE
I wouldn't be caught dead. No,
it's probably how I would be
caught. The Mayor stupidly took
Cobblepot's bait --

SELINA
-- and it's gonna be a hot time
in the cold town tonight.

Bruce glances at her, surprised.

BRUCE
You almost sound enthusiastic.

SELINA
(shrugs)
I detest violence, but ...
Christmas complacency can be a
downer, too.

BRUCE
(chuckles)
You've got a dark side, Selina
Kyle.

SELINA
No darker than yours, Bruce.

BRUCE
(muses)
Well, I'm... braver at night, if
that's what you mean...

SELINA
(surprised, glances over)
Yeah? Me too...

They pass the stage where, the Ice Princess is being re-
briefed on the difficult job of pressing the gaily multi-
colored button whose wires lead to the tree.

BRUCE
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.

SELINA
(brightens)
"We"? You and...

BRUCE
... and me.
(thinks)
No, that's be me and me.
(beat)
Is that what I said?

SELINA
(laughing)
Yes and no...

Laughing too, Bruce takes her hand and leads her off the
sidewalk just as Alfred pull up, playing chauffeur ...

INT. ICE PRINCESS' DRESSING ROOM TENT--NIGHT

She's alone, in front of the mirror, nervously primping
and reviewing:

ICE PRINCESS
The tree lights up, I press the
button ... No wait, I press the
button and --

She turns at the sound of her dressing room door opening.
Penguin waddles in, grinning the Ratty Poodle at his
heels.

ICE PRINCESS
(cold)
Who are you?

PENGUIN
Talent scout.

ICE PRINCESS
(warmer)
Come in! You know I don't just
light trees. I studied the Method.
By mail, but --

Penguin wrests the stolen Batarang from the Poodle's
jaws.

ICE PRINCESS
What is that, a camera or
something?

PENGUIN
Say cheese.

The Ice Princess strikes a pose.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM--EVENING

Nat King Cole on the stereo, does his romantic Yuletide
thing. Bruce and Selina, in matching mellow-melancholy
moods, sit close on the couch opposite a blazing hearth.

Alfred refills their eggnog, then discreetly ducks out.

SELINA
I'm sure he's wonderful company
and all, but ... doesn't the gold-
plated bachelor bit get a little
... stale?

BRUCE
Somewhat like the lonesome
secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.

SELINA
Executive Assistant.
(hell)
Secretary.
(then)
Girlfriend?

BRUCE
Had one. Didn't work.

SELINA
What went wrong? Hang on, I think
I know ... You kept things from
her.

BRUCE
Nope, I told her everything.

SELINA
And the truth frightened her?

BRUCE
(careful, pained)
Well ... How can I put this.
There were two truths ... and she
had trouble reconciling them.
Because I had trouble reconciling
them. Vicki said.

SELINA
(giggles)
"Vicki." Ice-skater, or
stewardess?

BRUCE
Photojournalist.

SELINA
Sure.

Now they both laugh. Selina tries to get serious again.

SELINA
Well? Was "Vicki" right? About
your difficulty with duality?

BRUCE
If I said yes, then you might
think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted
Bundy type ... and then you might
not let me kiss you.

Selina responds by leaning forward and planting a wet one
on Bruce's mouth, that lingers. When their lips finally
part:

SELINA
It's the so-called "normal" guys
who always let you down. Sickos
never scare me. At least they're
commited.

BRUCE
Ah ... then you've come to the
right lonely mansion.

They fall into another kiss. Now Selina starts to undo
his shirt. But Bruce remembers his Catwoman-wound, and
stops her. They kiss some more ... then he starts to
unbutton her blouse ... but she remembers her Batman-burn,
and stops.

They pull apart.

BRUCE
I, ah ... never fool around on the
first date.

SELINA
Nor I, on the second.

BRUCE
What're you doing three dates
from now?

Selina hops off the couch and crosses the room.

SELINA
Weren't we gonna watch the
Relighting of the Tree?

She flicks ON the TV. And there is PANDEMONIUM in the
Plaza.

INSERT--TV SCREEN

An ANCHORMAN standing in Gotham Plaza is jostled by
frenzied crowds, as he SHOUTS:

ANCHORMAN
We repeat ... The Ice Princess
has been kidnapped! And it only
gets worse ... Commissioner Gordon
... Can you confirm the reports
we're hearing, of Batman's
suspected involvement in the
abduction?

We GO LIVE to an ashen Police Commissioner, in front of
the Ice Princess's tent.

COMMISSIONER GORDON
The evidence is purely
circumstantial. We found this,
stained with blood, in the missing
girl's dressing room ...

He holds up a baggie that contains Batman's stolen
batarang.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - LIVING ROOM--NIGHT

Selina looks quietly shocked: How could she forget?
Corn Dog! Bruce is freaked too, but plays it cool.

BRUCE
Selina, I'm just gonna check on
those chestnuts, Alfred was roasting ...

He slouches out.

INT. WAYNE MANOR FOYER--NIGHT

Bruce sprints INTO FRAME, nearly colliding with his butler.

BRUCE
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the
Plaza. You heard Penguin, he was
practically begging me to show.

ALFRED
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.

BRUCE
(backing out)
'Fraid I can't. There's been a
kidnapping ... Tell Selina ...
Ms. Kyle ... that some business came
up -- no, tell her some major deal
fell through, she'll feel sorry ...
No, no, here's what to do, just tell
her ... let her know that I ... not in
a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --

ALFRED
I will relay the message.

BRUCE
Alright, thanks.

Bruce bolts.

INT. LIVING ROOM--NIGHT

Selina waits a moment, then sneaks out, into:

INT. THE FOYER--NIGHT

Where she bumps into Alfred.

SELINA
Alfred! Hi. I --

ALFRED
Ms. Kyle. Mr. Wayne told me to
tell you that --

SELINA
Mr. Wayne. Bruce.
Yes ... Would you tell him for me
that I've been going through a lot
of changes and ... no, don't say
that. Just ... this is not a
rejection, my abruptly leaving,
it's ... In fact, tell him he makes
me feel the way I hope I really
am ... no ...
(laughing)
If you whip up a sonnet,
something -- a dirty limerick ...

ALFRED
(smiles, assures her)
One has just sprung to mind.

Selina laughs, exits.

INT. BATCAVE--NIGHT

Opening his vault, Bruce breaks out the Bat suit and
begins to get into it.

INT. SELINA'S VOLKSWAGEN--NIGHT

As she drives, Selina pulls her Catwoman outfit out from
underneath the single-woman-old-People-magazine-Diet-
Cola-can detrius of her Volkswagen.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD--NIGHT

The VOLKSWAGEN CHUGS away.

EXT. A GOTHAM ALLEY--NIGHT

The Batmobile coasts into a deserted alley. Batman bounds
forth and activates the car's security shields.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--NIGHT

Klieg-lights sweep the plaza, as though everything was
fine. The rattled Mayor is at the mike, trying to
maintain calm.

MAYOR
People .. fellow citizens ...
There's no need for panic, this
can still be a party that Gotham
will remember for --

His tremulous voice overwhelmed by SHRIEKING feedback.

EXT. GOTHAM ALLEY--NIGHT

Led by the Poodle Lady, the Ratty Poodle hobbles to the
mouth of the alley. There's the Batmobile.

Behind them come Penguin's perverse crew, each holding a
toolbox.

The Knifethrower Dame climbs atop the security cloak with
a crude laser device. She jimmies the laser and with a
whoosh, the shield sputters off.

Each Gang-member sports a meticulous drawing on a
protruding headpiece, so he can scan the card while
toiling with both hands. The Red Triangle Gang begins
taking apart the Batmobile.

EXT. ATOP A GOTHAM PLAZA BUILDING--NIGHT

Hidden in shadow, Batman cautiously surveys the crowd.
Amid the feedback, sentence fragments waft up from the PA:

MAYOR
... incess will be safely ... atman
will be brought in for ques ...

Now Batman notices a building across the alley. In the
one open window sits a bound and gagged Princess.

Batman fires across a grapple to the ledge above.

EXT. GOTHAM ALLEY--NIGHT

The Batmobile has been dismantled like a post-Thanksgiving
turkey. Wires are twisted. Clamps are added. The piece
de resistance is A BEACON/ANTENNA that is placed carefully
beneath the vehicle.

EXT. LOFT LEDGE--NIGHT

The viewer catches Batman on the last squeak of a swoosh-
ing ride, into:

INT. LOFT--NIGHT

All that's in here are the Ice Princess and the chair
she's lashed to. Batman pulls out her gag. She BABBLES
her thanks as we BRING UP the WHINE of SIRENS, below. As
Batman struggles to untie the many knots, restraining her:

BATMAN
Gotta hurry. I was set up to look
like I did this --

ICE PRINCESS
No sweat, I'll just tell the police
I was kidnapped by an ugly little
birdman with fish breath.

CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Did someone say 'fish'?

She drops from the ceiling.

CATWOMAN
Yummy, I haven't been fed all day.

Then she kicks out at Batman -- but the came-to-play
Crusader grabs her heel and twists her down, face first.

BRUCE
Eat floor. High fibre ...

Catwoman springs up, pouting.

CATWOMAN
Hey stud: I thought we had
something together.

BATMAN
We do.

He head-butts her. But Catwoman quickly recovers, then
back-flips to the Princess and talons her free. Tosses
the chair at Batman as she drags the squealing Princess
through a door.

CATWOMAN
Gotta go, girl-talk, guys keep
out!

Batman swats away the flying chair and hustles after
them. The door is dead-bolted. He crunches it open.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE--NIGHT

Catwoman wrenches a resisting, squealing Ice Princess up
a fire escape. Batman rumbles after them, a floor behind.

EXT. GOTHAM ALLEY--NIGHT

The Gang busily backtracks, restoring the Batmobile to
its original state.

The Knifethrower Dame reactivates the security shield as
the Gang skedaddles.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE--NIGHT

Batman crashes up the last flight, onto...

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP--NIGHT

Catwoman has vanished. The Ice Princess stands here,
near the lip of the building, shivering in her skimpy
costume.

ICE PRINCESS
She let me go. I think 'cause
I reasoned with her, girl to girl.

BATMAN
(cautious, approaches)
Okay .. just slowly move toward
me ... away from the edge ...

As the Ice Princess takes a tentative step forward:

PENGUIN'S VOICE
Look out -- lawn dart!

He steps into the light and lofts an umbrella.

Its sharp point sticks in the roof, an inch from the
Princess's big toe. The umbrella automatically opens,
releasing several live baby bats, that swarm up at her.

BATMAN
No -- don't panic --

Batman bounds to her aid, but the Ice Princess steps
back, away from the bats, losing her balance ...

One sweeping Klieg-light catches Batman as he rushes
at the Ice Princess, arms outstretched to save her.

The other Klieg lights the Princess herself, as she
topples off the building!

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--NIGHT

A huge crowd is gaping up at the terrible scene.

CROWD MEMBER
Batman? Batman pushed the
Princess!

The devastated Mayor and his staff follow, with their
heads, the trajectory of the Princess -- which corre-
sponds to that of their careers.

Her body slams down onto the gaily multi-colored button.

This makes the Christmas tree come to life, but not with
lights. Instead a legion of EEKING BATS bellow out from
the tree's branches and swoop uopn the crowd, violently
rearranging a hundred hair-do's.

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP--NIGHT

Both Batman and Penguin stand here (on opposite ends of
the roof), looking down on the mind-boggling pandemonium.

PENGUIN
Bats with wings, do your things ...

Batman turns on Penguin, to do irreparable injury, but
the rooftop door flies open (hiding Penguin) and a
squadron of Cops drop into combat position.

BATMAN
Wait --

COMMISSIONER GORDON
Hold your f--

Too late. The volley of bullets violently ripple against
Batman's armor, sending him over the edge of the building.

He clangs onto a terrace railing, then lands on
another ...

EXT. TERRACE--NIGHT

An enfeebled Batman tries to stand, but is gently pushed
back down by Catwoman's sexy straddle.

CATWOMAN
You're catnip to a girl like me:
handsome, dazed, and to die for.

As she leans down to kiss him cat-style (a lick on his
lips) Batman sees, above her head, a hanging sprig of
mistletoe.

BATMAN
A kiss under the misteltoe.
Mistletoe can be deadly, if you
eat it ...

CATWOMAN
But a kiss can be even deadlier,
if you mean it.

She unfastens his Bat-belt, flings it off the terrace.

EXT. TERRACE--NIGHT

Still straddling the winded Crusader:

CATWOMAN
You're the second man who killed
me this week. But hey, no prob ...
I've got seven lives left.

BATMAN
I tried to grab you -- save you --

CATWOMAN
Seems like every woman you try to
save ends up dead, or deeply
resentful.

She savagely pulls him up.

CATWOMAN
Maybe it's time to retire.

She viciously claws at his face, and mask, but Batman
feints back and does a reverse swan-dive off the terrace.

EXT. IN AIR--NIGHT

As Batman falls, a pair of balsa wood-enforced, black
cloth kite-wings extend out and open.

EXT. PLAZA BELOW--NIGHT

Gotham citizens gape at the bizarre sight of Batman flying
amid his real-life counterparts.

EXT. GOTHAM ALLEY--NIGHT

Batman continues to swoosh ever downward. He edges out
before the crowd. Parallel to the ground, Batman glides
into the alley for a skidding, quasi-crash, leaving him
barely conscious. The black balsa batwings crunch to
pieces in the tumble. The Batmobile looms at the end of
the alley.

EXT. THE TERRACE--NIGHT

Catwoman turns away from the scene of Batman's disgrace.

CATWOMAN
You said you were going to scare
the Ice Princess.

Penguin is standing here, with a battered Tiffany box.

PENGUIN
And I kept my word! The lady
looked terrified.

He opens the box, revealing a hideous engagement ring.

PENGUIN
Let's consummate our fiendish union!

CATWOMAN
(sneers)
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.

PENGUIN
I oughta have you spayed! You
sent out all the signals!

CATWOMAN
(moment of doubt)
Did I? Only 'cause my mom trained
me to, with a man... any man, all
men --
(slaps her forehead)
Corn dog!

Enough self-hate. Catwoman redirects her rage at Penguin.

CATWOMAN
Me, domesticated? By you? I doubt
it! You repulsive... awful...
penguin.

PENGUIN
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.

He hooks the umbrella's handle around her neck. It auto-
matically curls into a tight semi-noose, then the ribs
start to spin, shredding the pannels... it's now a tiny
helicopter...

PENGUIN
And the wedding's been called off.

Catwoman is yanked up, into the air. Penguin wistfully
waves fairwell. Then mopes away.

EXT. GOTHAM SKYLINE--NIGHT

Catwoman whirls through the Gotham sky.

She painfully stretches out with her claws and tears
open the strangling handle. She is released.

Catwoman makes a dazzlingly awesome freefall plunge,
finally crashing through a skylight into...

INT. A PENTHOUSE GREENHOUSE--NIGHT

and a tableful of flowers. She lies for a moment in
stunned silence then bursts into an inhuman wail that
shatters the greenhouse glass.

EXT. PLAZA--NIGHT

Penguin is escorted through the crowd toward a CAMPAIGN
BUS emblazoned "Cobblepot, Soft He's Not". Gothamites
offer encouragement, which cheers him a tad ... he
presses buttons upon his more bosomy supporters ... which
cheers him a lot.

INT. CAMPAIGN BUS--NIGHT

Invigorated, Penguin moves straight to a twisted-tech
remote control panel of switches, buttons and levers,
all labeled with the various functions of the Batmobile.
As a bonus, there's a mini-steering wheel. Cackling,
Penguin grabs it.

EXT. GOTHAM ALLEY--NIGHT

Batman staggers toward his car. He undoes the security
cloak on the deceptively pristine Batmobile. A CROWD OF
PURSUERS of the "There-he-is-Don't-let-him-get-away"
variety, swing around the corner.

Batman quickly crashes down into the driver's seat and
takes a breath of guarded relief when suddenly the doors
loudly lock. All systems on the control panel flash on
by themselves. The engine cacophonously VROOMS.

INT. THE BATMOBILE--NIGHT

Batman pounds his fist into a Batmobile window to no
effect. Penguin's face comes on the screen the same way
Alfred's innocuously did before.

PENGUIN (screen)
Don't adjust your set. Welcome
to the Oswald Cobblepot School
of Driving. Gentleman, start
your screaming...

The vehicle thunders forward, slamming him back.

EXT. THE BATMOBILE--NIGHT

blasts from an alley, freaking out his pursuers, and
makes a wild turn into the street.

INT. CAMPAIGN BUS--NIGHT

Penguin rambunctiously joggles the steering wheel. On
one screen, he sees Batman's tensed face. On another
screen is a Batmobile-eye view.

PENGUIN
Maybe this is a bad time to mention
it, but my license has expired.
Of course, so have you.

INT. THE BATMOBILE--NIGHT

Batman tears off a shard of his console. Rips and tugs
at various wires...

INT. CAMPAIGN BUS--NIGHT

PENGUIN plays his controls like the Phantom of the Opera.

INT. BATMOBILE--NIGHT

Levers on the console move down by themselves. Batman
uses Hurculean strength to push them back up.

PENGUIN
(onscreen)
Batman... I know you're not having
a swell time, but lemme tellya:
Taking control of your vehicle,
mowing down decent people, and
laying the bad vibes squarely on
you ... makes the hairs in my
nose tingle.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--NIGHT

There is a major traffic jam on this one-way street
caused by two cars involved in a fender-bender. The two
angry Drivers are out of their vehicles, arguing; a Cop
tries to mediate. Meantime sixteen or so cars are backed
up. Suddenly, from down the block, there's a NOISE loud
enough to drown out all the blaring horns. Everyone
turns back, to silently gape at:

The Batmobile, blasting up the block! It's plowing
stopped cars out of its path onto the sidewalk, where
some crash through storefronts! Now the Batmobile
reaches the head of the line ...

As the two stunned Drivers stop arguing and just stare
in horror, both their vehicles are sent flying -- one
hits a fire hydrant and shears it clean off! A heavy
geyser of water shoots up and strikes the electrical
insulator suspended above, knocking the large coil onto
the wet sidewalk. Now the coil starts to short, firing
off sparks, setting a small store afire as the Batmobile
streaks out of frame, to continue its trajectory of terror.

INT. BATMOBILE--NIGHT

As Batman continues to tear at his console:

PENGUIN
(onscreen)
Just relax, and I'll take care of
the squealing, wretched, pinhead
puppets of Gotham.

EXT. ANOTHER GOTHAM STREET--NIGHT

A pack of Gothamites flee in different directions,
leaving a stranded old lady immobile with fear. The
Batmobile spectacularly angles right at her. She's a
bunny paralyzed by the headlights.

INT. CAMPAIGN BUS--NIGHT

Penguin licks his lips as the Batmobile zooms toward her.

PENGUIN
Helpless old lady at twelve o'clock
high.

He presses down on the accelerator.

INT./EXT. THE BATMOBILE--NIGHT

Batman yanks open a ceiling panel, revealing another
myriad of wires and fuses. He stares with harsh
concentration. He pulls out a round fuse.

The Batmobile squeaks to a sudden dead halt, centimeters
before the vibrating then fleeing old lady.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET--NIGHT

The steel jack-type device again explodes out of the
bottom of the Batmobile, lifting it up off the ground.
But instead of going into a simple, suave 180 twist,
the car convulses into a Tasmanian Devil spin that
revolves it at mind-roasting speed. A battalion of
police cars surround it. Officers jump out and begin
firing.

INT. THE BATMOBILE--NIGHT

Penguin's image on the spinning screen surreally
cackles....

INT. CAMPAIGN BUS--NIGHT

Penguin twists the Square knob some more, as he squawks:

PENGUIN
Ya gotta admit ... I've played
this stinking city like a harp
from hell!

EXT./INT. THE BATMOBILE--NIGHT

spins even faster. Batmobile drives his fist through the
screen, shutting up his nemesis.

Then he kicks and tears open a panel on the floor.
There's a thick tangle of wires and spinning gears down
here. Batman bravely plunges his glove through the mess,
pounding out a hole through the Batmobile's gleaming
black skin...

Looking up at the underside of the Batmobile, we see
Batman reach down through the hole and find the gang's
Beacon Rod.

He snaps it in half.

The jack is sucked back up and the Batmobile breaks out
of its cartoon swirl and rockets between two police cars,
smashing a third as it speeds off.

INT. CAMPAIGN BUS--NIGHT

Frustrated, Penguin pounds the controls.

PENGUIN
Came this close to a perfect
evening! Iced the princess. Blew
away Batman. Almost got married.
Killed the bitch. This close..!

EXT. STREET--NIGHT

The two Police Cars give chase, blowing out their
weaponry at the Batmobile.

INT. THE BATMOBILE--NIGHT

Batman floors the pedal while rummaging through his con-
sole's twisted wires. With his free hand, he makes a
sharp right turn.

DEAD-END STREET

The Batmobile swooshes onto a road that has two brick
buildings towering at the end of it with only a small
not-quite-a-car-let-alone-a-Batmobile-size gap between
them.

THE POLICE screech behind them.

POLICEMAN
(shouts)
He'll never fit!

INT./EXT. THE BATMOBILE--NIGHT

The Batmobile streaks closer to the building. The cops
continue to fire.

Batman sparks two wires together. The windshield wipers
come on.

BATMAN
(gently puzzled)
That's funny...

The buildings loom before the windshield.

BATMAN
(with a strange laugh)
Now I'm a little worried....Oh.

Batman connects two wires.

EXT. BATMOBILE--NIGHT

The sides of the Batmobile break off and clang to the
ground and the wheels of the car remarkably contort in a
single-file roller blade configuration, leaving only a
sleek missile of a car that smoothly darts between the
two buildings.

EXT. THE STREET--NIGHT

The lead cop car tries to follow, but gets wedged between
the buildings. The cop car behind piles into it!

EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDINGS' GAP--NIGHT

The Bat-missile-mobile slashes out of the gap. Then does
a suave, angled speed skate around a corner. And
disappears.

EXT. PLAZA--NEXT DAY

Max escorts Penguin -- er, Oswald Cobblepot. Despite the
heavy turnout for the "Recall The Mayor" rally, Penguin
(twirling a red-white-and-blue umbrella) is cranky.

MAX
... So he survived ... C'mon, be a
mensch, stand t...

Max trails off. Penguin is giving him that "my nose
could be gushing blood" look.

PENGUIN
He didn't even lose a limb, an
eyeball ... bladder control ..

MAX
Point is, listen to them. They've
lost faith in old symbols.
They're ready to bond with you, the
icon of the future. If it works,
don't fix it...

He fairly pushes the grumpy Penguin onto a platform.

MAX
We'll celebrate tonight, at my
annual Max-squerade ball. Shreck
and Cobblepot, the visionary
alliance.

Penguin takes the mike, looking grouchy and uninspired.

Down in front, a shameless, toothsome Cobblepot-Groupie
flashes major cleavage, as though Penguin were a pop star.

This heartens Penguin. He quickly rises to the occasion.

PENGUIN
(booming squawk)
When it came time to ensure the
safety of our city, did the Mayor
have a plan? No, he relied on a
man. A "bat" man.

Somewhere in the crowd stands Selina. Staring poker-
faced at the podium, her gaze flicking between Penguin
and Max Shreck.

INT. WAYNE MANOR STUDY--DAY

Bruce and Alfred watch "Cobblepot's" address on TV.

PENGUIN
(onscreen)
A ticking time bomb of a costumed
freak who finally exploded last
night, spraying this city with
shrapnel of shame!

Bruce rises. Rolls up a sleeve as he moves to his aquarium.
Sticks in his arm, puts two fingers through the window of a
miniature Wayne Manor. Fish swarm his wrist...

ALFRED
I'm less worried about this ghastly
grotesque... more concerned about
repairing the Batmobile. It's not
as though we can simply bring it
to any old Joe's Body Shop. Is
it, sir?

Bruce pulls out a key. And laughs.

BRUCE
Hey, who let Vicki Vale into the
Batcave? I'm sitting there
working, I turn around, it's like,
"Oh hi, Vick, c'mon in."

Then on to a medieval Iron Maiden set in a corner across
the room. He muses:

BRUCE
Selina ... more facets than Vicki,
huh? Funny, but sort of mysterious...

BRUCE
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if
she ...

ALFRED
I think I'll take the stairs.

The spikes retract and the bottom drops out of the Iron
Maiden, as it closes.

INT. THE BATCAVE--DAY

Bruce slides out of a chute, then strolls to a console.
He pulls out the CD he'd pocketed last night, and inserts
it into a sleek aparatus as Alfred comes puffing
downstairs.

Penguin is still posturing, on a large SCREEN down here.

PENGUIN
You ask, am I up here for personal
glory? Ha ... I toiled for many
years in happy obscurity, beneath
your boulevards ... No, the glory
I yearn to recapture, is the Glory
of Gotham ...!

Alfred, all the while, is manning his own console. He's
punches in a command, "Find Frequency", which quickly
brings up the read-out "Frequency Found". His next typed
command, "Jam Frequency" soon yields the read-out
"Frequency Jammed."

Alfred nods to Bruce: time to play. Bruce presses Play.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA STAGE--DAY

PENGUIN
How can this be accomplished? I
know you're all concerned.

Suddenly his mike goes dead -- but his VOICE keeps RINGING
out over the Plaza, somehow.

PENGUIN'S VOICE
Hey, just relax and I'll take
care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham.

Penguin is stunned.

PENGUIN
Wait a sec -- I didn't say that.

But nobody can hear his unamplified voice, over the
recorded one, from last night.

PENGUIN'S VOICE
Ya gotta admit ... I've played this
stinking city like a harp from
hell!

As his Campaign Workers back off the stage, the puffed-up
Oswald Cobblepot reverts to the limping, twisted Penguin.

INT. THE BATCAVE--DAY

Like a sophisticated rap Club DJ, Bruce "scratches" the
CD.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--DAY

The single phrase loudly resounds, again and again, as
Penguin helplessly stands here, lips moving but unheard.

PENGUIN'S VOICE
"This stinking city, stinking
city ..."

Mortified, Penguin spazzes -- looking, for a second, like
a rapper. His performance is greeted with snowballs ...
then a couple of eggs and tomatoes find their way to his
face.

Finally Penguin gallops away from the mike -- bumping into
Max Shreck, who is fighting to get off the platform.

Penguin claws at his mentor, losing a glove in the
process.

PENGUIN
Max! Relax! Josh and Jen'll put
a spin on this. We'll talk it over
tonight, at your costume par--

MAX
(shakes his head)
I think you'd feel out of place at
my party. You see, it's for
winners.

He scrams. Leaving Penguin wiping his face and wondering:

PENGUIN
Why is there always someone who
brings eggs and tomatoes to a
speech!?

When suddenly a posse of livid Gothamites, ripping off
their Oswald Cobblepot buttons, come at him like a human
wave.

EXT. GOTHAM PARK--DAY

Penguin makes a wild dash through the park, just ahead
of the angry mob, barely leaping a park bench. As the
Gothamites gain, he turns, FIRING a salvo from his
patriotic umbrella. In response, the Park Cops unholster
their weapons and shoot back. Penguin saves himself by
diving off the storybook bridge -- the very bridge his
parents dumped him from, many Christmases ago -- splash-
ing deep into the icy brook.

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR--DAY

Penguin trudges, head down, out of the abyss of his sewer
pipe back into the light of his Lair. Thuds into his Rubber
Duck boat and revs it toward the abandoned Arctic island.

Oblivious to his pain, his penguins squawk and play.
This brings a dark smile to the Penguin's thin lips.

PENGUIN
My babies ... Did you miss me?

As he docks his Duck, the remaining members of the Red
Triangle Circus Gang straggle into the lair through a
tunnel of Snow and Ice. The Thin Clown pops into his
face.

THIN CLOWN
Great speech, Oswald. The way you
told those rubes the score!

Penguin brutally smacks the Clown's skull with his umbrella.

PENGUIN
My name's not Oswald, it's Penguin!
(burst of renewal)
I am not a human being! I'm an
animal! A cold-blooded one.
Crank the a.c.!

He yanks off his tux, rips off his other glove and wiggles
his webbed hands, as he rallies his gang.

PENGUIN
I'm glad this happened. I've
learned a little somethng: I
don't want their "love". Their
"love" is false and suffocating.
Ah, but their hatred and disgust
-- that frees me! Anyway it's
too damn muggy up there!
Christmas, right? And I'm
schvitzing.

The Gang clucks its sympathy. Penguin claps his hands.

PENGUIN
Where's my list!? Bring me the
names!

A beat, and then the Knifethrower Dame is here, with
Penguin's stack of legal pads he'd filled at the Hall of
Records.

PENGUIN
It's time. What I've been waiting
for my whole putrid life. They
had their chance, they blew it,
and now they'll pay ...

Penguin hops around with dark glee, like Rumpelstiltskin.

PENGUIN
Oh, what a collosal bill has come
due! Gotham will never forget.

He tears pages from the pad, starts handing them out. The
Red Triangle Hoods are reading the names ... "Evan Black,
181 Shepherd Lane"... "Thomas Frankel, 273 Carlton Avenue"
... frankly confused.

PENGUIN
These are the first-born sons of
Gotham City! Like I was! And
just like me, a terrible fate waits
for them.

The surviving Circus Members send up a changed-my-mind
CHEER.

INT. THE BATCAVE--NIGHT

Bruce works on the battered Batmobile, rewiring, etc.
The TV SCREEN is on ... a press-conference with the
Mayor. We catch phrases like "Return to normalcy" and
"Seen the last of that hateful charlatan ..."

Now Alfred appears, holding the invitation to tonight's
ball -- away from him, as though it smells.

ALFRED
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder: Tonight
is that loathsome party, hosted
by that odious Mr. Shreck. May we
RSVP in the resoundingly negative?

BRUCE
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it
is an occasion for celebration,
and ... umm ... Selina will probably
be there ...

ALFRED
Ah.
(then)
"Who", may I ask, are you going
"as"?

BRUCE
(ambiguous smile)
You'll never guess.

INT. THE SPOOKILY REBUILT DEPARTMENT STORE--NIGHT

Max Shreck stands on a platform before a microphone, wear-
ing a scary black leather jacket-and-everything-else-
ensemble with a vivid red eye-mask.

MAX
Attention Shoppers...

A SWARM OF PARTY GUESTS laugh appreciatively, also
in COSTUME--costumes that are exotic, erotic, evil, and
pretty stupid. An ARMORED KNIGHT lifts his visor to
bulge his eyes at this annoying behavior. It is Alfred.

As Max speaks, one takes in the rejuvenated department
store, still eerily burnt around the edges. New and
glitzy Christmas decorations shine. The whole store has
been bathed in seductive nightclub lighting.

MAX
Like this splendid department
store, Gotham can quickly bounce
back from the tumult of the past
days ... So deck the halls, and
shake your booties!

A BAND behind Max launches into a sultry headbanger.
Guests begin to groove out on a make-shift dance floor.

Max gives a "forgive me?" toast toward the vindicated
Mayor who is dressed in a Roman Toga that sprouts a
Caesar-style myriad of plastic daggers and fake blood.

Various people are in Batman and Catwoman outfits,
including an undulating couple on the dance floor, Josh
and Jen. Josh is Catwoman. Jen is Batman.

JOSH
Jen, look over there, but don't
stare.

JEN
(staring)
My god. How rude.

They are revealed to be looking at Bruce Wayne strutting
down the main aisle, dressed dramatically as......BRUCE
WAYNE. The only one without a costume, Bruce catches
some glares from the hedonists. He and Max shake hands,
trading chilly smiles.

MAX
Ingenious costume. Let me guess
... Trust-fund goody-goody?

BRUCE
Course you're feeling fine ... You
almost made a monster the Mayor of
Gotham City.

MAX
I am the light of this city. And
I am its mean, twisted soul. Does
it really matter who's the "mayor"?

BRUCE
It does to me.

MAX
Yawn.

He drifts off. Bruce considers having the last word, when
his attention is diverted to a new guest, entering. It's:

Selina Kyle, dramatically dressed as ... Selina Kyle. She
draws the same sour looks as Bruce did. And ignores them,
as Bruce did. Gives Bruce a lovely, world-weary smile.

INT. STORE DANCE FLOOR--NIGHT

Chip Shreck is dressed as an old-time football hero, in
knickers, etc. He moves, warily, across the floor ...

CHIP
Selina ... Ms. Kyle... May I have
this --

Bruce cuts in and Selina lets him: The band does a
ballad as Selina flows into Bruce's arms. They nakedly
dance amid the swathed-in-artifice revelers.

BRUCE
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big
deal came together, no, fell
through, and --

SELINA
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my
cat.

BRUCE
No hard feelings?

Selina presses against her partner. Smiles.

SELINA
Actually ... semi-hard, I'd say.

Bruce blushes, steps back. Selina does a sultry
pirouette.

SELINA
There's a big, comfy California
King over in Bedding. What say
we ...

BRUCE
(ironic)
Y'mean take off our costumes?

SELINA
(sad laugh)
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...

BRUCE
Same here. So why'd you come
tonight?

SELINA
You first.

Bruce presses close to her again.

BRUCE
To see you.

He waits for a response. Selina pauses, then:

SELINA
That's lovely and I really wish I
could say the same, but ... I came
for Max.

At first, Bruce doesn't understand.

BRUCE
You don't mean ... you and Max ..?

Selina gives a harsh laugh, shakes her head.

SELINA
This and Max.

She discreetly pulls a little derringer from her evening
bag. Shocked, Bruce pushes it back in her bag.

INT. THE SEWER BELOW THE STORE--EVENING

The spooky ballad wafts into a sewer below the Store.
The lights of the party radiate through the grate of a
ventilator shaft. Rising into this strange mix of music,
light, and slime is Penguin's Rubber Duck. On its
scissor-lift, it continues to climb, at first revealing
Four Penguin Shock Troops, in bizarre headgear, missiles
pointed straight up.

INT. STORE--DANCE FLOOR--NIGHT

Bruce and Selina continue to dance, emotions rising.

SELINA
Now don't give me a killing-Max-
won't-solve-anything speech,
because it will. Aren't you tired
of this sanctimonious robber baron
always coming out on top? When he
should be six feet under?

BRUCE
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge
or the jury... I mean, just who do
you think you are?

SELINA
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...

They glide together beneath a piece of hanging mistletoe,
and she gives a soft, almost regretful kiss. And laughs.

SELINA
A kiss under the mistletoe.
Mistletoe can be deadly, if you
eat it ...

BRUCE
But a kiss can be even deadlier,
if you mean ... it.

And suddenly it hits them -- what? No! Can it be?

BRUCE SELINA
You're ... her? You're ... him?

Bruce tenderly, carefully undoes the cuff of Selina's
blouse and pulls back her sleeve. Feels:

BRUCE
The burn I gave you.

Meanwhile Selina's hand explores under Bruce's shirt, finds:

SELINA
The puncture wounds I gave you.
(wearily)
Oh god ... does this mean we have
to start fighting now?

Bruce's answer is to hold her tight. He's scared, so is she.

SELINA
... What do we do?

BRUCE
I don't know. Till we figure it
out, let's ... let's keep dancing.

That works for Selina. They sway on, to the haunting song.

Alfred is standing next to Commissioner Gordon, watching.

GORDON
A darling couple.

ALFRED
Yes, made for each other ...

Abruptly a square of dance floor EXPLODES, sending Bruce,
Selina, Chip, Max, Josh, Jen, Alfred, Gordon, et al,
sprawling.

Erupting up from the sizzling hole is Penguin, in his
Rubber Duck. In addition to the Four Penguins, he's
brought the Organ Grinder with his Gatling gun. The
Revelers SHRIEK as the Organ Grinder introduces his boss:

ORGAN GRINDER
Yes, Virginia, there is an anti-
Christ!

PENGUIN
You didn't invite me, so I
crashed!

Once again, the Mayor steps forward.

MAYOR
What do you want ... "Penguin"?

PENGUIN
Nothing from you ... "Putz".

He pushes the Mayor out of the way. And announces, to the
horrified throng:

PENGUIN
Right now, my troops are fanning
out across town, for your
children ...
(over gasps)
Yes, for your first-born sons ...
The ones you left helpless, at
home, so you could dress up like
jerks, get juiced on Max's
Shreggnog...

As those closest to the bomb blast dazedly pick themselves
up off the dance floor ...

PENGUIN
I've personally come for Gotham's
favorite son ... Mr. Chip Shreck!

The Organ Grinder grabs a struggling Chip holding him with
an ornate handgun.

A woozy Selina turns, to her dance partner:

SELINA
Bruce ... we have to do someth ...

Then trails off. Bruce has slipped away, in the confusion.

Penguin crows, as Chip is hustled over to the Rubber
Duck:

PENGUIN
You're coming with me, you Great
White Dope! To die, way down in
the sewer!

MAX
Not Chip! Please! Penguin ...
If you have one iota of human
feeling, you'll take me instead.

PENGUIN
I don't. So, no.

MAX
(grabs Penguin's coat)
I'm the one you want! Penguin,
please! Ask yourself: Isn't it
Max Shreck who manipulated and
betrayed you? Isn't it Max, not
Chip, whom you want to see immersed
up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?

PENGUIN
(removing Max's hands)
Okay, you have a point. Plus, the
hysterics are getting on my nerves.

Then barks:

PENGUIN
Let Knute Rockne live. For now.

The Organ Grinder frees Chip, grabs Max. Forces him into
the Rubber Duck. Penguin jumps in after them.

As the Rubber Duck swooshes back down into the hole, the
penguins cover the escape by firing a smokey volley:

Smoke bombs ... that create massive, coughing chaos ...

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT (MONTAGE)

The Red Triangle Gang sweeps the city for its first-born
sons.

1.  A Darling Little Boy sits at the window-sill,
    dreamily staring out. Suddenly a CLOWN pops up,
    into view.

DARLING LITTLE BOY
Finally. The tooth fairy ... What
do I get?

We see he's lost a front tooth.

CLOWN
Why, the ride of your life. Hey
c'mon, little guy ...

The Clown reaches out a hand. The Boy eagerly steps
up onto the sill, then disappears into the night ...

2.  A cute bathroom. Sheep, daisies, and the Alphabet
    adorn the walls. A Toddler is standing here, making
    faces at himself in the mirror, and giggling. OS, we
    hear:

NANNY'S VOICE
Billy ... If you're not brushing,
I'll tell your Mama ...

Suddenly, in the mirror, the Organ Grinder appears,
monkey scampering across his shoulders. The Toddler
starts to scream, but the Organ Grinder clamps a huge
hand over his mouth --

3.  A plush nursery. An Infant boy peacefully sleeps in
    a custom-wood crib. An Acrobat-Thug quietly vaults
    through the window. Scoops up the infant, vaults out
    as an alarm WAILS, but the Infant sleeps on --

The montage quickly accelerates: a swift succession of
sleeping, bundled babes handed through windows, doors ...

INT. LAIR - NIGHT

Penguin impatiently waits, pacing as he twirls two
identical long, elegant umbrellas.

PENGUIN
Ooh, this is gonna be good...

He turns to Max, confined to a cage half-submerged in
goo, clutching a tattered blanket against the cold.

PENGUIN
To cut down a whole crop of
Gotham's most promising, before
their prime...

He gestures at a brown-ish gurgling subterranean lake.

PENGUIN
How do I lure 'em in, you ask?

He pops one of the umbrellas at Max, who flinches.

PENGUIN
Little "Pied Penguin" action...

The umbrella is wickedly charming... open, it's a mini-
merry-go-round, playing the "Penguin Theme" in a haunt-
ingly childlike rinky-dink style. Penguin shows, with
a happy prance, how he'll use it to lead the kids to
their doom.

PENGUIN
And you get to watch them all sink,
in a deep puddle of your industrial
by-products. Then you join them.
Tragic irony or poetic justice?
You tell me.

We DISSOLVE from the twirling merry-go-round umbrella to
a WAGON-WHEEL, turning ... then WIDEN to REVEAL:

EXT. "CIRCUS TRAIN" - NIGHT

The lead circus wagons in a long caravan of wagon, wind-
ing through Gotham's dark and empty streets. The wagons
are barred, more heavily than in Dumbo. Reminiscent, in
fact, of Penguin's playpen of yore. The sides painted
with the faded, peeling Red Triangle Circus logo.
Through the heavy bars, we glimpse a little pair of
hands, a pair of frightened eyes ... HEAR the occasional
CRY of a cold or thirsty baby.

At the wheel sits the Organ Grinder, impatiently petting
his monkey. Now he barks, at his unseen subordinates:

ORGAN GRINDER
Would'ya hurry up loading those
kids already..?

A shadow falls... The silhouette of a caped figure...
Batman reaches down and yanks the Organ Grinder UP out
of frame!

INT. LAIR - NIGHT

As a silent, despairing Max Shreck and a manic, amused
Thin Clown look on, Penguin practices his balletic walk
over to the toxic lake, waving his merry-go-round
umbrella with its tinkly THEME.

PENGUIN
(dry run)
This way, kiddies ... Jump right in!

Now the Organ Grinder's monkey appears at the top of the
stairs, holding something. As he scampers down:

PENGUIN
So ... Where're the kids? Don't
tell me they stopped at McDonald's ..?

THIN CLOWN
Boss ... he's got a note!

Indeed, the monkey waves a little piece of stationary,
which Penguin snatches from him. And reads:

PENGUIN
"Dear Penguin: The children
regret they're unable to attend.
Have a disappointing day. Batman."

Penguin is working to control his rage. He glares at the
hopping, dancing monkey, and reminds himself:

PENGUIN
You're the messenger. It doesn't
make sense to shoot the messenger.

The other long umbrella is a semi-automatic. Now Penguin
swivels, and sprays the Thin Clown with bullets.

INT. ELSEWHERE IN THE LAIR--NIGHT

Penguin militarily struts as he addresses his legion of
penguins. They're wearing eerie headgear. On each one's
back is strapped a large bazooka.

PENGUIN
My penguins ... We stand at a great
threshold. It's okay to be
scared. Many of you won't be
coming back ...

He's choked up. He has to pause, compose himself.

PENGUIN
Thanks to Batman, the time has
come to punish all God's chillun ...
first, second, third and fourth-born,
why be biased? Male and female ...
hell, the sexes are equal with
their erogenous zones blown sky-high ...

In this area are TV monitors scavenged from the Arctic
World info-pavilion and other technology cannibalized
from the old exhibit. Today the screens show various
angles of the sleeping city. The Fat Clown mans the
controls.

PENGUIN
Forward, march! The liberation of
Gotham has begun!

The Penguin Army, on remote control, swivels in unison
and splashes toward the big open sewer pipe.

Behind them, Penguin dries his eyes and gloats:

PENGUIN
The Grinch just stole Christmas.
I'm gonna kill it, barbecue it,
chop it up and chew its bones!

INT. A SEWER--NIGHT

All is quiet in a musty sewer. Then a buzzing noise is
faintly heard, and suddenly Batman plows at the viewer,
driving a sleek, dark vehicle that is part boat, part
jet-ski. The Bat Boat slaloms up the side of the sewer
pipe to avoid colliding with:

A division of penguin Commando Bombers, marching in
unison. Their headgear clicks and whirs.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY STREET--NIGHT

Another squadron of penguin mercenaries pours out from an
open sewer grate and continues to march in eerie forma-
tion through a deserted city street.

INT. THE SEWER--NIGHT

As he rockets ahead, Batman communicates through a
strange phone device:

BATMAN
I'm homing in on the signal's origin...

INT. BATCAVE - SAME TIME

Alfred is poised at the same console at which he'd
jammed Penguin's speech.

ALFRED
Ready when you are, sir.

INT. THE SEWER OF BATMAN--NIGHT

Batman motors further...

BATMAN
Got the coordinates. They're --

Two penguins suddenly appear before Batman, firing their
payloads. Batman savagely curls his boat all the way up
the oval pipe until he is momentarily upside down. He
swooshes back down past the penguins and the twin
explosions.

BATMAN
As I was saying...

INT. THE LAIR--NIGHT

Penguin stands in front of a screen, watching his army
waddle down the street. Then gleefully rubs his hands
as the Fat Clown starts the countdown, off a big clock:

FAT CLOWN
Ten, nine...

PENGUIN
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !

FAT CLOWN
... eight, seven...

PENGUIN
("sweetly" sings)
Silent night, violent night...

FAT CLOWN
(sings along)
All is shrill, all is blight...

EXT. GOTHAM STREET LEADING TO PLAZA--NIGHT

The vanguard penguin division stops. Gotham Plaza,
heavily populated, looms ahead. As one, the penguins
bend forward, angling their bazookas for maximum
destruction.

INT. BATCAVE - SAME TIME

The last of the coordinates crackles over Alfred's
headset.

BATMAN (V.O.)
... 28 degrees west. Shall we?

ALFRED
(punching buttons)
Let's dance. Sir.

The read-out reads: FREQUENCY JAMMED.

EXT. THE REGIMENT OF PENGUINS--NIGHT

The Penguins' headgear begins to whine and rattle.

The penguins simultaneously turn and trot away from the
Plaza.

INT. THE LAIR--NIGHT

Penguin is glued to the screens, elated at a Gotter-
dammerung that's only seconds away.

PENGUIN
Ah, Gotham. You wouldn't put me
on a pedestal, so I'm laying you
on a slab!

Meantime the Fat Clown is frantically punching the
controls.

FAT CLOWN
Well, um... funny thing, your
penguins... they're not responding
to the launch command. Fact
they're kind of turned around
now... Like someone jammed our
signal...

PENGUIN
But who could've ... no, don't say
it.

FAT CLOWN
My lips are sealed.

Penguin punches up the controls so the image of Batman
plowing through the sewers is spread out across the
screens in Cinerama.

PENGUIN
I'm starting... just starting...
to lose my temper, now.

EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT

The Penguin army advances, en masse. The Old Zoo looms
in the distance.

INT. THE LAIR--NIGHT

Penguin grabs the nearest umbrella and jumps into his
Rubber Duck.

The Fat Clown rushes forward to join him but Penguin
heedlessly slams his vehicle into his former cohort --
catapulting his huge carcass across the lair where it
lands with a definitive THUD in front of Max's cage.

Penguin steers his Duck for stairs -- then rides it
all the way up the stairs, and out of the lair.

Meantime Max reaches out and grabs a key off the Fat
Clown's key-ring, releasing himself. Then creeps out of
his cage. He pauses to swipe the gun from the Fat
Clown's holster and stashes it in his back pocket. Then
starts to dash off when a familiar cat 'o nine tails
SNAPS into FRAME, coils around his ankle and drags him
OFF-SCREEN.

INT. SEWER - NIGHT

As Batman thunders up the pipe toward the lair, he hears
a BLEEP. The screen on his console shows a thermal
image -- shaped like a duck -- heading for the surface.

Batman has just reaches a fork in the sewer pipes. At
the last second he spins the wheel, steering into the
pipe that angles up.

EXT. ARCTIC WORLD--NIGHT

Penguin grandly plows around a corner with a victorious
laugh --

Simultaneously the Bat-boat comes crashing through the
top of Arctic World --

Penguin stops laughing as he looks up and sees the Bat-
boat in mid-air --

It crash-lands on top of Penguin's Rubber Duck!

A beat of silence. Stillness. Batman, dazed, pops open
his cockpit and alights, looking for Penguin. For
Penguin's corpse perhaps ... pinned inside his Rubber
Duck ... when:

From out of frame, a shrill and frenzied Penguin springs
at Batman! His legs wrapped around the Caped Crusader's
neck, the beast savagely gouges (with his umbrella-tip)
and pecks (with his beak)! Snarling, as he attacks:

PENGUIN
I think you're jealous that I'm a
genuine freak, and you have to wear
a mask!

BATMAN
Maybe you're right.

Penguin jumps down, off Batman.

PENGUIN
But in the end all that counts, is:
Who's holding the umbrella?

He activates his umbrella -- a long blade protrudes.
In response, Batman pulls out his weapon: a palm-sized
multi-colored button (like the one that lit the Gotham
Plaza Christmas tree). A stand-off. But now, over
Batman's shoulder, Penguin sees:

Standing here -- what the hell are they doing here? --
his poker-faced Penguin commandos.

PENGUIN
My babies ...

Batman turns to look -- and Penguin lunges with his
umbrella-sword. Batman swipes at it, dropping his
button-weapon in the process.

Cackling, Penguin snatches it up. Aiming it at Batman,
he vengefully presses the button.

Suddenly an insane family of bats billows out of
breakaway panels in the Batboat and thunders straight at
the Penguin.

PENGUIN
Ah, you brought your in-laws. I'm
sure, once you get to know them --

He tries to swat them away with his umbrella, but the
bats besiege Penguin, biting and screeching as they send
him reeling back and down, shattering through the
observation window.

INT. THE LAIR - NIGHT

Penguin spectacularly twirls down into his lair, bats
tearing at him all the way, until he splashes down into
the moat.

EXT. ARCTIC WORLD - NIGHT

Batman, at the Observation window, looks down. Penguin
is submerged, but he can see the struggling Catwoman and
Max.

Simultaneously the Penguin Army -- headgear clacking,
back on schedule -- launches its payload.

Batman, standing between them and the old zoo, now looks
up at the magnificent trajectory of missiles overhead ...

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS--NIGHT

The grand panorama of rotten zoo cages and decayed Expo-
tecture is mightily laid to glorious waste in a symphony
of fireballs.

INT. THE LAIR--NIGHT

Flaming debris from the big bombs has devastated the
floe, melting most of the ice, and blasting the odd chunk
out of the warmed-up water.

Revealed in her arousingly tattered costume, Catwoman
is dragging Max by his neck toward the Lair's ominously
buzzing electrical generator.

MAX
I don't know what you want, but I
know I can get it for you with a
minimum of fuss. Money, jewels, a
very big ball of string...

CATWOMAN
Your blood, Max.

MAX
My blood? I ... I gave at the
office.

CATWOMAN
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.

EXT. ARCTIC WORLD - NIGHT

Batman darts to the Observation window and looks down at
the struggling Catwoman and Max below.

He hooks a grapple to the edge of the glass.

INT. THE LAIR--NIGHT

Catwoman continues to drag a balky Max toward the
generator.

MAX
Let's make a deal. Other than my
blood, what can I off--

CATWOMAN
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.

MAX
Either you've caught a cold, or
you're planning to kill me.

Batman does a slide down the grapple that ends in a
graceful touchdown. Max crawls toward him.

MAX
You're not just saving one life,
you're saving a city and its WAY
of life.

Batman heaves a kick into Max that sends him sailing
against the generator.

BATMAN
First you're gonna shut up. Then
you're gonna turn yourself in.

CATWOMAN
Don't be naive. The law doesn't
apply to people like him! Or us --

BATMAN
Wrong on both counts.

He tries to grab Max, but Catwoman makes a lunge for
Batman's abdomen sending him reeling. He picks himself
up, then, talking in a calming, soothing way:

BATMAN
Why are you doing this? Let's
just take him to the police, then
go home together ...

She's still for a moment, considering.

BATMAN
Don't you see, we're the same... split
down the middle... please...

Batman rips off his mask, looks straight at her.

CATWOMAN
Bruce, I could live with you in
your castle forever. Just like in
a fairy tale.

She leans forward as for a kiss. Batman touches her face
about to rip off her mask. But she whips back, lashing
out at him, kicking him, sending him stumbling backward.

CATWOMAN
I just couldn't live with myself.
So don't pretend this is a happy
ending.

Max, recovering, pulls out the Organ Grinder's gun.

MAX
Selina! Selina Kyle!? You're
fired! And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne!
Why are you dressed up as Batman?

CATWOMAN
He is Batman, you moron.

MAX
(raising the gun
again)
Was.

Max squeezes off a shot at Batman as he rises, nicking
the Caped Crusader's neck. Now Max swings the gun
toward Catwoman -- who sexily saunters right at him.

CATWOMAN
You killed me, Batman killed me,
Penguin killed me. Three lives
down. Got enough bullets to
finish me off?

MAX
One way to find out?

He fires a shot, that rips into her arm. And another,
that smashes into her leg. Still coming, she pulls off
her hood.

SELINA
Four, five. Still alive.

Batman rips off his own mask and woozily holds his
bleeding neck. He's on his knees, dizzy and weak ...

BRUCE
Selina ... please, stop ...

Max shoots her other leg and the hand holding the stun-
gun, blowing away the barrel. Selina's left gripping a
sparking gun-butt. She hobbles forward.

SELINA
Six, seven, all good girls go
to ...

Max pulls the trigger. But he's shot his wad.

SELINA
Hmm, two lives left. Think I'll
save one for next Christmas.
Meantime how 'bout a kiss, Santey
Claus?

A panicked Max has backed against the generator.

CATWOMAN
You're the light of Gotham City?
So be the light of Gotham City!

Selina shoves the sparking half-a-stun-gun into her
mouth like a suicidal pacifier, then grabs Max in a
close embrace.

MAX
(seriously weirded)
What're you --

She plunges her steel talons into an open fusebox and
gives Max a stunning kiss! Their bodies briefly buck
together before getting lost in a dense display of
crackling sparkage.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--NIGHT (SAME TIME)

The lights of the city vividly flash on and off, a
vision that Max had prophesied ...

The Batm Beacon eerily winks against the sky.

The grand Christmas Tree brilliantly blinks. Now we see
that the Plaza is filled with ecstatic Parents, reunited
with dazed and delighted Children ...

INT. THE LAIR--NIGHT

Catlike screams of joy waft out off the mysterious mist of
wattage.

BRUCE
Se-li-na Kyle...

Bruce frantically searches the thickening mist...
but finds only Max's body, not Selina. He stumbles back,
as:

Penguin rises like a wraith behind him, soaking and
bleeding and sweating. Wiping his brow and gasping for
breath, he stumbles toward the shorted-out compressor,
using his long, elegant umbrellas for support.

PENGUIN
(pants)
Gotta crank the a.c. Stuffy in
here.

He drops one umbrella. With his free flipper, Penguin
vainly twiddles the singed dials. Nothing -- the unit's
kaput. Fiery rubble continues to rain down on the lair,
raising the temperature even higher. penguin turns away
in defeat from the busted air-conditioner. And sees:

A stone-faced Bruce/Batman standing here, pitilessly
watching.

PENGUIN
Without the mask you're drop-dead
handsome. So, drop dead.

With great effort, he raises his elegant umbrella. And
fires it. No ... not quite. It's the merry-go-round.

PENGUIN
Shit. Picked the cute one.
Heat's gettin' to me ...

Penguin reaches down for the other umbrella ... the
deadly one ... the one that Bruce/Batman is holding.

PENGUIN
Hey. You ... wouldn't blow away
an endangered bird ...

He desperately tugs at his collar a la Rodney. His face
is turning a deep, pre-coronary scarlet ...

Bruce/Batman wordlessly raises the umbrella and aims it
between Penguin's eyes.

Penguin pivots. Starts waddling away. Huffing,
puffing ...

PENGUIN
You wouldn't shoot me in the back ...
would'ya ..?

Bruce/Batman never takes the gun/umbrella off Penguin ...

Who is waddling, slower and with greater difficulty,
toward the once-icy, now-nearly-melted moat.

PENGUIN
I'm overheated, is all ... I'll
murder you, momentarily ...

With a last ounce of strength he pulls open his collar.

PENGUIN
But first, a cool drink ...

Then one more step ... and he bellyflops in front of
one glistening, beckoning chunk of ice that was blown
out of the water.

PENGUIN
Of ice-water ...

One flipper feels for the block of ice ... it's just an
inch away ... And then the flipper falls.

Penguin belongs to the ages.

A beat, then Bruce/Batman sets down the deadly umbrella
and silently watches, slightly awed:

In death, as in birth, the Four Elder Gray Bellied
Emperor penguins surround their fallen disciple. Then,
like pallbearers, they lift Penguin's body with their
beaks and mournfully bear him away, into darkness.

EXT. GOTHAM PLAZA--NIGHT

The bat beacon light, the city lights, and the Christmas
tree lights continue to flash in wondrous syncopation.
The Carolers begin singing again.

EXT. CITY HALL--NIGHT

The Mayor, his staff, and Commissioner Gordon, out of
their costumes, look up at the flashing bat signal.

GORDON
Think he'll ever forgive us?

MAYOR
Probably not. But he'll always
help us.

EXT. WAYNE ROLLS-ROYCE--NIGHT

Alfred drives. As the limo zips past Gotham Plaza, Bruce
soulfully gazes out at the celebrants.

BRUCE
(numb)
I guess this mean we won.

ALFRED
Yes, I suppose that we did.

He turns, taking a short-cut away from the crowds,
through a dark back alley ...

ALFRED
Well ... Come what may... Merry
Christmas, Mr. Wayne.

BRUCE
Right. Sure. And "Peace on earth,
good will toward men."

Suddenly he's brought up short by a loud meow. Bruce
glances behind him ...

In time to see the shadow of something dart from the
street into an alley. Was it just a cat ..? Or some-
thing taller, shapelier?

Bruce shivers.

BRUCE
And women.

TILT UP. In the night sky, the Bat beacon blinks on ...
then off, on then off, as we move closer and closer, till
Batman's symbol fills the screen ... on, then off --

AND CUT TO BLACK.

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM - NIGHT

A castle of shadow. (OVER) RAIN, HOWLING evil wind.
Sudden lightning CRACKS, illuminates the aged structure,
the hanging metal sign.

INT. ASYLUM CORRIDORS - NIGHT

DR. BURTON, the Chief Psychiatrist moves down the old
hallway, face tense. He steps through a doorway into...

INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY - NIGHT

Security cells. Criminal maniacs sealed behind protective
casings.

A GUARD stands before a heavy door.

GUARD
Hell of a night, huh Doc?

BURTON
Hell's in here.

Hydraulics HISS. The cell door unseals.

INT. SECURE ISOLATION CELL

Small. Walls, ceiling, floor, padded. A single window
casts the room in pallid moonlight.

A figure sits in shadow, bound by the wraps and ties of a
straight jacket, gaze fixed out the window.

Lightning flashes, brightening the room. THUNDER CRACKS.

DR. BURTON
Mr. Dent...

No answer. Burton steps closer.

DR. BURTON
Counselor...

Still nothing. Another step.

DR. BURTON
Harvey....

Burton reaches towards the figure.

DR. BURTON
Harvey are you alright...

Burton touches his shoulder. Lightning flashes as...

THE BODY WHIPS around. An orderly, gagged, sits bound to
the chair with bedsheets.

The sheets around the chair have been rigged. Now they
yank him up so he spins frantically from the ceiling fan.

Lightning flashes again, illuminating a madman's scrawled
writing on the wall.

WRITING - CLOSE. "The Bat Must Die!" THUNDER

EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - SUNSET - FALL

Gothic towers of granite and glass shimmer golden in the
late day sun.

MOVE IN towards the city as an executive helicopter
CROSSES FRAME. Through the window BRUCE WAYNE, still
handsome but a few lines starting to show, sits watching
a seatback video screen.

CONTINUE In over Gotham Harbor towards the skyline as
(OVER) A NEWSCASTER talks.

NEWSCASTER
...And in Gotham City, ex-District
Attorney Harvey Dent escaped from
Arkham Asylum for the Criminally
Insane.

CLOSER on a single building, its power generated by a
small but mighty dam below. A glowing sign reads Wayne
Enterprises.

NEWSCASTER (OVER)
Dent, once Gotham's leading
contender for Mayor, was horribly
scarred during an indictment hearing
over a year ago.

HOLD on a single window. MOVE IN

INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S OFFICE

Elegant. Oak. A wall monitor runs the same newscast.

INSERT SCREEN

Dent questions a crime boss on the stand. A thug throws a
vial of acid toward Harvey, searing half his face.

NEWSCASTER (OVER)
Dent, whose left-brain was damaged
during the assault, launched a
grizzly crime spree before being
captured by The Batman. He is
extremely dangerous. Repeat....

WIDER

Bruce Wayne ENTERS, his Armani suit the only thing fresh
about him, followed by a sudden stream of EXECUTIVES,
SECRETARIES, ASSISTANTS and GOTHAM SOCIETY MATRONS.

EXECUTIVE
The solar generator tests are back.

BRUCE
Uh... great, could you wait a
second...

ASSISTANT
The Mayor's office called again -

SOCIETY MATRON
Who are you asking to the circus -

SECRETARY
Five minutes to your inspection -

BRUCE
Stop!

Everybody freezes.

BRUCE
Okay, I want you all to just stand
here for fifteen seconds, okay?
Fifteen, everybody got it?

Folks nod.

BRUCE
Good. Nobody move, now.

And with that, Bruce turns and walks out.

BRUCE
(to himself)
I gotta give myself a raise...

INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - ELECTRONICS DIVISION - TWILIGHT

Endless work-spaces stretching into infinity.

Bruce, a Junior Exec ENTOURAGE trailing, tours an
assembly line where robotic arms weld laser tools.

FRED STICKLEY, a fuss-budget plant manager, leads.

STICKLEY
Your weekly inspections are a
departmental highlight.

BRUCE
Really?
(a warm smile)
You all need to get out more.

CRANE UP high over the factory floor, across acres of
assembly lines and work stations.

ANGLE DOWN on

INT. EDWARD NYGMA'S WORK STATION (CONTINUOUS)

A clutter of computer parts. Paperwork everywhere.
Rubik's cubes, games, dozens of puzzle books all boasting
the green suited caricature of "The Guesser".

MONITOR-CLOSE. A crossword puzzle.

Features reflect over the acrostic. The two images
resolve into one; the face itself is a puzzle.

REVERSE ANGLE

EDWARD NYGMA, awkward, brilliant and feverishly anxious
stares up at the screen, TALKING to himself.

EDWARD
We'll probably go to the house for
dinner. Yes. Yes. Maybe he'll throw
a little party in my honor.

Suddenly Edward BANGS his head against the desk-top.
Hard. A brief window on the inner Edward, all insecurity
and self loathing.

EDWARD
Idiot! Should have rented a tuxedo.
(suddenly calm)
Relax. I'm sure Wayne manor has
extra. After all, we're almost the
same size.

The opposing wall is a shrine to Bruce Wayne: newspaper
headlines, a GQ cover, magazine photos.

Approaching COMMOTION.

EDWARD
Oh my God. It's him.

INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - BREAK AREA

Workers greet the boss. Bruce is friendly, welcoming,
Edward appears on the edge of the group.

Stickley spots Edward. A cloud crosses his face.

STICKLEY
Well, Mr. Wayne, on to R&D?

Stickley rests his hand on Wayne's elbow. Begins to steer
him away. Not in time.

Edward steps forward. A man so uncomfortable, his very
skin seems to be a costume. He marches right up to Wayne,
takes his hand, fawning, the burning eyes of a sycophant.

BRUCE
Mr...?

EDWARD
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.

BRUCE
(easy going)
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce
Wayne. And you are?

EDWARD
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me.
Personally. Just like I tell
everyone.
(sotto voce)
Well, we've never actually met, but
your name was on the hire slip.

He still hasn't let go of Bruce's hand.

BRUCE
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.

EDWARD
What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry.
It's just that...you're my idol.
(off Stickley)
And some people have been trying to
keep us apart.

BRUCE
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for
being rude. But what exactly is on
your mind?

EDWARD
Precisely. What's on all our minds?
Brainwaves. The future of Wayne
Enterprises is Brainwaves!

It's hard to imagine anyone more awkward. The effect is
painful. Folks stare, mouths wide.

STICKLEY
(sotto voce)
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne.
His project was terminated this
morning...

EDWARD
(ignoring Stickley)
Let me ask you something, Bruce.
What is man's greatest tool?

A few of the WOMEN SNICKER. For a second, Edward's face
twitches, a crack in the facade.

EDWARD
Man's greatest tool is...The mind.

Edward gestures to his cubicle. A rat's nest cluttered
with components of his Rube Goldberg-like invention.

EDWARD
Voila. While holographically
enhancing any TV picture, my
invention connects directly to the
viewer's brain, puts the audience
inside the show. Think of the
entertainment problems we can solve.

STICKLEY
I can think of a couple problems
that need solving right here.

A few more folks CHUCKLE. Edward looks around. Another
ripple of anxiety, another quick recovery.

EDWARD
Why be brutalized by an uncaring
world? My RES Box will give Joe Q
Public a realm where he is king.
(sultry)
Not that someone like you would need
it. Someone so intelligent. Witty.
Charming. But for the lonely, the...

STICKLEY
Paranoid? The psychotic?

EDWARD
(didn't miss it)
...The Box can change their lives.
(looking around)
Our stock coupons will spike.

Edward turns, actually CLAPS Stickley on the back.

EDWARD
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley
here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?

STICKLEY
Fred?

Bruce takes off his glasses, rubs his eyes in vague
disbelief, cleans the lenses.
EDWARD
Wayne Enterprises will spearhead an
entertainment revolution.

Edward removes his glasses, cleans them in exactly the
same manner as Bruce.

EDWARD
I just need a bit of additional
funding. For human trials. Let me
show you....

Bruce seems about to speak when suddenly -

THE BATSIGNAL

beams bright against the night clouds over Gotham City.

BRUCE
(time to move)
Maybe some other time..

EDWARD
I want you to know, we'll be full
partners in this, Bruce.
(waxing rhapsodic)
What talks we'll have, late into the
night. Now, I'm not used to business
travel, so go easy on me. As for
recognition, I'm sure after a time
I'll get used to it.
(a beat)
Look at us. Two of a kind.

Edward is suddenly aware of dozens of co-workers all
around him, SNICKERING and WHISPERING.

EDWARD
Bruce...?

Bruce's eyes dart again toward the Batsignal.

BRUCE
Call my secretary, she'll set
something up.
(turning)
Factory looks great, folks. Keep up
the good work.

EDWARD
(desperate)
Wait. You can't go.

BRUCE
We'll talk some other -

EDWARD
(sudden rage)
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I
need you!

Edward has grabbed Bruce's arm. The room goes dead quiet.
Bruce's eyes narrow. Then he dislodges gently.

BRUCE
I'm sorry, Edward. Just feels a bit
like mind manipulation. It raises
too many question marks.

Bruce heads off.

STICKLEY
Alright everyone, back to work.
(to Edward)
We'll discuss this later.

Edward stares after Bruce.

EDWARD
You were supposed to understand.

HOLD on this tiny man, all alone in the labyrinthine
work-place, eyes darkening now with growing obsession.

EDWARD
I'll make you understand.

INT. BRUCE WAYNE's PRIVATE OFFICE

Bruce ENTERS.

BRUCE
Lock.

THE DOOR - CLOSE. LOCKS. Bruce falls into a leather chair.

BRUCE
Capsule.

Suddenly the chair seat drops, fast, sliding into a
transport capsule.

INT. TRANSPORT TUNNEL

The capsule shoots through the underground tunnel, lights
WHIPPING past at near super-sonic speed.

INT. CAPSULE

Speed and time readouts appear on the windscreen beside
the craggy face of ALFRED PENNYWORTH.

BRUCE

ALFRED
I saw the signal, is. All is ready.

Alfred watches the capsule arrive.

QUICK CUTS of glove, boot, and cape being donned.

INT. BATCAVE

FOLLOW Batman's feet as he steps up to the Batmobile.

ALFRED
I suppose I couldn't convince you to
take along a sandwich.

Batman jumps into the Batmobile.

BRUCE
(to Alfred)
I'll get drive-thru.
(to the car)
Go...

The car shoots a whitish-blue light from under it's
belly. Hub Caps and detailing glow as The Batmobile zooms
out of the cave.

INT. CAVE ACCESS TUBE

The car SHOOTS through a series of underground arches.
The car picks up speed, the blue-white fusion drive going
blue, then purple, then red. The single bat wing splits
into two as the car becomes a stealth bullet.

EXT. WAYNE ESTATE - NIGHT

The dark car WHIPS through a holograph of trees that
masks the entrance to the Batcave, SCREECHING onto...

EXT. FOREST ROADS - NIGHT

The car speeds towards Gotham.

ANGLE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW ON

The Batsignal, cutting the darkness.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT. SECOND BANK OF GOTHAM - 22ND FLOOR - NIGHT

A worried THUG peers at the Batsignal out the skyscraper
window. Across a narrow abyss stands a skyscraper under
construction, all girders and scaffolding.

In f.g., a spinning silver dollar flips up into frame,
blocking out the Batsignal.

THUG
Bat should show any minute, Face.

A HAND catches the coin, flips it again.

WIDER

Witness the rakishly handsome profile of HARVEY TWO-FACE
DENT, the other side of his face hidden in shadow.

TWO-FACE
You. Sport. Any thoughts? Counting
on Batass to rescue you?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A SECURITY GUARD, laying on the floor, wrists and feet
bound, trembling with fear.

TWO-FACE
_We_ sure are.

GUARD
...You gonna kill me?

TWO-FACE
Might. Might not. Could say we're of
two minds on the subject.

GUARD
I got family. ...Please.

TWO-FACE
What say we flip for it?

Two-ace shoves the silver dollar under the Guard's nose.
One side shines in mint condition.

TWO-FACE
What could be fairer than the random
toss of an honest coin? Life...

The other side bears deep, disfiguring burns.

TWO-FACE
...or death.

GUARD
Please. I swear I won't say noth-

TWO-FACE
The coin _wants_ to decide.

Two-Face flips. The coin spins, gleaming, lands on the
floor only inches from the Guard's face.

Two-Face STOMPS the coin. Winks at the sweating Guard.

TWO-FACE
Exhilarating, isn't it? The
suspense? Sudden death or a new
lease on life? Really makes a man
live in the moment.

Two-Face removes his foot. Unblemished side up.

TWO-FACE
You're in luck. You get to live to
whimper another day.

The Guard SOBS with relief. Harvey's Thugs GRUMBLE.

Two-Face folds his jacket into a pillow, places it under
the Guard's head, now the nicest crook in the world.

TWO-FACE
That floor has got to be very hard.
Is that better?

GUARD
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.

TWO-FACE
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you
a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all
the trouble we caused you, how about
we cut you in for a share of
tonight's haul?

THUG
Face! For cryin' out loud! You're
not gonna pay him--

Two-Face turns on Thug 2 with a vengeance, shooting out a
hand that pins the fellow's throat to the wall.

TWO-FACE
Did we ask your opinion? The coin
has rendered its verdict. This man
has a family to take care of. You
have a problem with that?

We now see for the first time the LEFT HALF OF HIS FACE:
hideously repulsive, an acid eaten mutilation of flesh.

THUG
Oh no, Face. Anything you say.

EXT. PAN-ASIA TOWN - STREET - NIGHT

Sweeping spots. Swat teams. Police wagons.

COMMISIONER GORDON, 50s, a man who's seen enough pain
for a lifetime, stands in his trademark trenchcoat,
lighting a cigarette.

Beside him stands a beautiful, professionally dressed
young woman. DR. CHASE MERIDIAN.

HIGH ABOVE

The Batmobile SCREECHES to a stop on a pedestrian bridge.

THE BATSIGNAL is suddenly obscured, flows for a moment
into the shape of Batman's cape as the Dark Knight leaps
down past the spotlight, lands face to face with Chase.

CHASE
Hot entrance.

Batman turns, all business as he speaks to Gordon.

BATMAN
Two-Face?

GORDON
Two guards dead. He's holding the
third hostage. Didn't see this one
coming.

CHASE
We should have, though.

The men turn to face her.

CHASE
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be
transferred from the _Second_ Bank of
Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey?
_Two_-Face resist?

BATMAN
And you are?

GORDON
Batman, I'd like you to meet--

CHASE
(offering her hand)
Chase Meridian

GORDON
I asked Dr. Meridian to come to
Gotham to consult on this case. She
specializes...

BATMAN
...dual personalities. Abnormal
psychology. Washington's poster
child for the criminally insane. I
read your work.

CHASE
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes
a super-hero's night table. You
might have some interesting insights
into Two-Face.

BATMAN
Why's that?

CHASE
Let's just say I could write a hell
of a paper on a grown man who
dresses like a flying rodent.

BATMAN
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

CHASE
I didn't know that. See? You _are_
interesting. And call me Chase. By
the way, do you have a first name? Or
do I just call you bats?

GORDON
May I remind you two we have a
psychopathic murderer on the loose
here?

A titanic BOOM rocks the night.

SEARCHLIGHTS race up the skeletal skyscraper to REVEAL..

A giant CRANE and WRECKING BALL. The wrecking ball
SMASHES again into the bank building.

INT. BANK OF GOTHAM - NIGHT

The already crumbling wall behind Two Face EXPLODES. Two-
Face checks his watch, unfazed, as the giant wrecking
ball CRASHES into the room within inches of the villain.

TWO-FACE
Right on schedule.

Two-Face's men scramble to the hole, attach chains to...

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

...an even thicker chain dangling 30 stories from the
roof of the construction site.

FOLLOW THE CHAIN UP as it yanks tight, revealing...
A BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER already atop the construction
site, perched on steel beams. REVVING its mighty rotors.

A giant winch aboard the Blackhawk starts to haul the
safe chain over pulleys up into a cargo hatch.

INT. - SECOND BANK OF GOTHAM. 22ND FLOOR, NIGHT

Thug 1 stares out the window.

THUG
The Bat's taking the bait! What now?

Harvey flips the coin.

FOLLOW THE COIN as Two-Face snatches it from mid-air,
slaps it on his wrist. Bad side up.

ANGLE ON - Two-Face's left side. Scarred, gloating evil.

TWO-FACE
At last, The Bat dies!

The chains suddenly yank the safe towards the hole in the
wall. Thug 2 gestures to the Guard on the floor.

THUG
What about him?

TWO-FACE
Kill him too.

Thug 2, grinning, draws a GUN from his waistband.

GUARD
Wait! You said you'd let me go!

TWO-FACE
Never heard of a double-cross?

A DING from the elevators.

The Thugs and Harvey all whirl, machine guns coming up,
open FIRE, armor piercing bullets punching holes in the
metal doors, shredding anyone inside.

THE GUARD lays bound on the floor. Suddenly a clamp-ended
bat-cable drops from above. With a tiny CLICK, the smart-
clamp hooks onto the Guard's wrist bindings.

ELEVATORS

HARVEY AND THUGS empty magazines. Re-load.

TWO-FACE
Come on in, the water's fine.

All stand watching as the now perforated elevator doors
slide, jerking, open to reveal...an empty elevator.

The skylight overhead EXPLODES and, in a rain of glass,
Batman drops to the floor on a Batrope.

THE GUARD is apparently attached to the Batrope's other
end because, as the Caped Crusader comes down, the Guard
shoots up, hoisted fast to the safe rooftop above.

FIRE DOORS

BLOW open. Two SWAT teams burst in, armed for bear.

SWAT LEADER
Police! Freeze!

TWO-FACE
Not the guest list we had in mind.
Boys, the party's over.

Two-Face drops a SMOKE GRENADE. Then he leaps directly
out the hole in the wall. His Thugs take off after him.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The Thugs come leaping through the hole, using the now
rising safe as a springboard to close the windy gap, roll
to safety on the construction site next door. They
scatter, begin scaling various beams and girders.

INT. BANK

Swat Teams race through the smoke in close pursuit, come
up short at the edge of the urban precipice. The safe has
risen too high, now, to serve as a springboard, so the
cops drop, begin FIRING across the gap. Suddenly...

A DARK WING explodes out of the smoke behind them, flying
across the abyss.

INT. CONSTRUCTION SIGHT

A Thug fires at the figure hurling towards him. Batman
lands on the Thug's chest, smashing him to the floor.

Suddenly, from above, BULLETS CRACK off the girders
beside the Caped Crusader's head.

REVERSE ANGLE

TWO-FACE glides upward, riding the wrecking ball as it
overtakes the safe, shooting down at Batman.

BATMAN starts scaling the scaffolding after Two-Face.
He's climbing fast but Harvey has too great a lead.

BATMAN - POV. A motorized gantry is carrying one of the
Thugs up to the roof.

Batman FIRES a Batarang. The bat-shaped clamp bites into
the wooden base of the rising gantry.

He toggles the launcher into winch mode, is hoisted fast
towards the rising gantry above.

ON THE GANTRY

The riding Thug leans down, sees the rising shadow, grabs
the Batrope in both hands and flips over the gantry.

ON THE BATROPE

The Thug slides fast down to kicking range, draws back
his boot to dispatch Batman.

Batman hits a switch on his launcher, increasing the
winch speed, shooting him higher, faster. He grabs the
Thug's foot in his hand, shoves him up so his head CRACKS
against the bottom of the gantry. Batman swings the
unconscious Thug onto a hanging construction hook,
leaving him dangling in mid-air by his nose ring, hoists
himself up onto...

THE GANTRY

From the scaffolding above, a Thug drops to one end of
the gantry, nun-chucks spinning madly.

Behind Batman, another Thug drops INTO FRAME, drawing a
machine pistol.

Batman reaches forward, grabs the Thug's spinning nun-
chuck, stunning his face with the wooden sticks. In a
single move, Batman spins and lets the weapon fly into
the pistoled assailant, knocking him flat.

BATMAN - POV. Two-Face has reached the chopper.

INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Two-Face climbs into the chopper's cargo bay.

TWO-FACE
(to the pilot)
Let's fly.

EXT. GANTRY - NIGHT

Batman sees the helicopter start to rise, pulling the
safe overhead along with it.

Batman jumps, drops through the abyss between the two
buildings, landing on...

A HIGH TENSION WIRE - CLOSE. The wire bends like a bow,
shooting Batman like an arrow straight into the air.

Batman grabs the rising chain, slides down it's links so
he is standing atop the safe.

He FIRES a Batarang into the bank wall, making an anchor,
attaches the Bat-cable to the hitch atop the safe.

INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The chopper is straining against Batman's bank-embedded
tether. Two-Face looks down in fury.

TWO-FACE
The man is taking his job
_much too seriously_.

EXT. TOP OF SAFE - NIGHT

Batman palms a compartment on his utility belt and a
small delivery mechanism SNAPS a tiny acetylene torch
into his gloved hand.

A BLUE FLAME ignites. Batman starts to cut the chains.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

Batman's torch slices the last link. Batman reaches up
and grabs the winch chain, is jerked suddenly upward with
the now un-tethered chopper as...

THE SAFE

now freed, swings like a pendulum on it's anchor line,
arcing straight for the hole in the bank wall from which
it was originally drawn.

INT. BANK BUILDING

The safe comes flying through the hole, sliding across the
floor and SLAMMING back into place before the bewildered
faces of the SWAT team.

INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Two-Face stares out the side of the chopper.

TWO-FACE
That was our money.

Two-Face grabs the controls from the pilot.

TWO-FACE
He wants to play. Fine, let's play.

Two-Face pulls back on the throttle, the chopper shooting
straight up into the sky like a rocket.

EXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT

Batman hangs from the chain, trailing the chopper, a wing
of shadowy quicksilver disappearing into the night.

EXT. ARKHAM SQUARE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

Gotham's Times Square. Tall. Narrow. The crawl of bumper-
to-bumper traffic. Glutted with neon signs and giant
animated billboards.

The helicopter ROARS into view. BATMAN hangs on for dear
life as the city rushes past.

A SERIES OF SHOTS as street folks look up in wonder.

SIGN - CLOSE. For Ginsu Knives. A couple of giant hands
make fast work of a steak on a smoking barbecue.

The chopper swings Batman _through_ the ad, falling blades
just missing him, dragging him through the thick smoke.

The chopper swings across the square, heading for...

ANOTHER SIGN - CLOSE. This time a tremendous set of
clacking teeth turn yellow to white each time the cap
lifts off of a giant tube of toothpaste.

The chopper barrels straight for the opening mouth.

At the last moment the chopper banks, whipping the
dangling Batman inside the mouth.

The mouth closes on the Caped Crusader.

The chopper pulls away, the chain pulling like floss
through the closed teeth.

INT. MOUTH

Batman, still clutching the chain, is flying towards the
barricade of closed teeth.

EXT. ARKHAM SQUARE - MOUTH SIGN

Batman SMASHES through the two front teeth.

BATMAN - CLOSE. His face suddenly bathed in an ever
brightening yellow glow.

INT. CHOPPER

TWO-FACE'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

Dead ahead, another sign. This one is essentially a giant
neon sun, the Wayne Tech logo burning bright yellows and
reds over the message Solar: The Power of the Future.

Harvey GUNS the chopper's engines.

PILOT
Face!!!

EXT. GOTHAM SKY

The chopper BLOWS straight through the nova, neon
EXPLODING like stars in all directions.

INT. HELICOPTER

As the Pilot, in the b.g. regains control of the chopper,
Harvey walks to the hold, looks down through the hatch at
the dangling chain below. No Batman.

TWO-FACE
Ah, to finally be rid of that pointy
eared, steroid eating, rubber
suited, cross dressing, night rat...

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

a familiar blue cape falls down over the plexi-glass.

PILOT
Uh...boss....

Harvey spins, draws his machine pistol.

PILOT
No!

Too late. Harvey SPRAYS wildly, blowing holes in the
windshield and Pilot as well.

EXT. HELICOPTER

The cape slips off the windscreen

INT. HELICOPTER

The chopper dives. Two-Face staggers towards the pilot's
chair. He rests free the corpse, regains control.

A FIST SMASHES through the side window into Harvey's jaw.

BATMAN
Harvey, you need help. Give it up.

EXT. HELICOPTER

Batman stands on one of the struts, begins trying to
climb into the open side of the speeding bird.

TWO-FACE
Words of wisdom from our ex-friend?

Harvey SLAMS Batman's face with his foot. He goes down.

TWO-FACE
Mano a Mano a Bato.

Batman pulls himself back up. Grabs Harvey's foot. Flips
him to the floor. Drags him half way out of the bird.

BATMAN
Surrender.

TWO-FACE
Ever been to Arkham, Batman? You'd
feel right at home. You took a year
of my life. So I'm here to pay you
back. There's only one way out of
this waltz. One of us dies.

BATMAN
I won't kill you, Harvey.

Batman gets Harvey by the throat.

TWO-FACE
Batman doesn't kill? Bullshit.
(epiphinous)
You're a killer too.

Somehow Harvey's words seem to shake Batman a beat. It's
all the distraction Harvey needs. He SMASHES Batman
across the face.

Batman slips, falls out of sight.

WINDSHIELD - CLOSE. Lady Gotham is coming up fast.

EXT. HELICOPTER

Batman hangs by one hand from the support strut, the bird
hurling towards the giant statue.

INT. HELICOPTER

Harvey locks "The Club" onto the controls, fixing the
chopper on it's deadly course.

Batman hoists himself into the chopper through the open
side in time to see Harvey standing over the cargo hatch.

TWO-FACE
Goodbye old pal.

With that Harvey leaps through the cargo hatch.

Batman stares frozen in disbelief as Two-Face plummets to
the dark water below.

Then a sudden flurry of expanding color caught in Lady
Gotham's lighthouse beam, and a parachute opens over Two-
Face, unfolding into a giant Yin-Yang.

BATMAN - POV - The windshield SHATTERS into the statue.

EXT. HELICOPTER - LADY GOTHAM - NIGHT

The helicopter EXPLODES into the left side of Lady
Gotham's face. A tremendous fireball splits the night.

EXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT

Batman is falling. Still. Eyes closed. Maybe dead.

FLASHES OF

(OVER) A SCREAM. Two SHOTS. A pair of roses hit pavement.

A BOY runs through a storm, a book clutched in his hands.

A FALL down a narrow stone chute, into a cave.

A BAT, huge, evil, SCREECHING.

TWO-FACE'S WORDS (OVER) - "YOU'RE A KILLER TOO."

BATMAN FALLING - CLOSE

Batman plummets towards the water. His eyes open.

EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR (CONTINUOUS)

Batman SPLASHES into the harbor. Dark. Still.

Then, a familiar cowl breaks the surface, GASPING for
breath. Batman stares up at the sky.

PAN UP

Lady Gotham's one beautiful face now burns the night.

INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - NIGHT

Dark, save the light from a single cubicle.

INT. EDWARD'S WORK STATION - NIGHT

Edward sits hunched over his desk, working on his
invention. Sweat beads his brow, lips MUMBLING furiously.

EDWARD
(obsessive repetition)
Too many questions. Too many
questions.

Edward glances up at the picture of Bruce Wayne.

EDWARD
I'll show you it works.

STICKLEY (O.S.)
What the hell is going on here?

Stickley stands before Edward's cubicle. Not happy.

STICKLEY
Your project is terminated. I'm
calling security.

Stickley turns to go. Mistake. Edward CRACKS Stickley on
the head with a coffee pot. Down he goes.

EDWARD
Caffine'll kill you.

INT. EDWARD'S CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER

Stickley awakens to find himself strapped in a swivel
chair. Edward is placing an elaborate computerized
headband over Stickley's head. (OVER) a small TV hooked
into Edward's contraption runs a fishing show.

EDWARD
This won't hurt a bit.
(musing)
At least I don't think it will.

Edward reaches for a small transceiver fused to the TV.

STICKLEY
Goddamnit, you press that button
and-

Too late. A green beam explodes from the TV screen,
engulfing Stickley.

IN THE BEAM - a small holographic representation of the
fisherman reeling in a prize bass.

STICKLEY - POV - As far as Fred is concerned he's on the
shore, the fisherman's catch flapping in his face.

The TV signals begin to waver and tremble.

EDWARD
Loosing resolution. More power.

He increases the power toggle. BACKFIRE. A sudden white
light shoots back into the TV and up, surrounding Ed.

STICKLEY - CLOSE. His eyes dull, glaze over.

EDWARD - CLOSE. The effect on him seems to be quite the
opposite. Invigorating, sexual.

THE BEAM-FLARES. A tiny nova. Overload. Both men SCREAM.
All light vanishes.

EDWARD - CLOSE. His face buried in his hands.

Edward peers up from his hands.

Look into his eyes. One thing is sure. Edward Nygma has
gone power mad, totally insane.

EDWARD
(game show host)
Fred Stickley. Come on down. You're
the next contestant on I Want Your
Brain.
(Wayne-like)
Nygma your machine has unexpected
side effects. A feed back loop has
caused your brain to absorb
Stickley's neural energy.
(hyper)
Stickley, I've had a break-
through! And a breakdown? Maybe.
Nevertheless. I'm smarter. Hell, I'm
a genius. More than a genius.
Several geniuses. Genae. Genie.

Ed rises, BABBLES a dazed Fred's lips with his finger.

EDWARD
(short order cook)
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of
brain deep-fry. Extra well done.
Hold the neurons.
(a scientist)
Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho
neural overload. Notation: obviously
higher settings can be dangerous to
the subject.
(pacing)
Riddle me this, Fred. What is
everything to someone and nothing to
everyone else? Your mind of course.
And now mine pumps with the power of
yours.
(urban)
New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think
faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate
every homey on the court of life. Da
pump. Yeah.
(Shakespearian)
Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant
for the anagramatic. The acrostic.
The crypto-graphic. What doth this
bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little
runt.
(gourmet)
Fred, I must confess you were a
wonderful appetizer. Simply divine.
But now I yearn for a meal of
substance. The main course. A wide
and varied palette. Ah, to taste the
mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.
(Groucho)
A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be
so bad either.

STICKLEY
...Fired...your fired...your fired.
You understand?! Fired!!

EDWARD
I don't think so.

Edward savagely sends Stickley careening across the slick
floor still strapped to the swivel chair.

Stickley heads straight for the huge round window.

Edward seems like he has regrets as he dashes after
Stickley. The chair...

SMASHES THROUGH THE ROUND WINDOW

It teeters on the edge of the building, dam and RUSHING
water below. Stickley is being held on the precipice by
the long wire attached to his headband. It is really only
this that Edward came to save.

EDWARD
Fred. Babe. _You_ are fired. Or should
I say Terminated!

He yanks the invention from Stickley's head and he
crashes below to certain death. Ed races back to...

EDWARD'S CUBICLE

EDWARD
Question marks, Mr. Wayne?

He stands staring at the picture of Bruce Wayne.

EDWARD
My work raises too many question
marks?

In a frenzy, Edward begins tearing up the magazines lying
on his desk, ripping out individual words, pasting them
quickly onto a blank piece of paper.

EDWARD
Two years. 3.5762 percent of my
estimated lifespan toiling for your
greater glory and profit.

He SMASHES the framed GQ cover of Bruce on the floor.

EDWARD
Well, let me ask you some questions,
Mr. Smarter Than Thou. Why are you
so debonair? Successful? Richer than
God? Why should you have it all and
not me? Yes, you're right, there are
too many questions, Bruce Wayne.

Edward STOMPS on the picture, pulverizing the glass.

EDWARD
Like why hasn't anybody put you in
your place? And it's time you came
up with some answers. Starting right
now!

A SERIES OF IMAGES-

(OVER) A SCREAM. SHOTS. Roses fall to the pavement.

A YOUNG BOY stands staring into a parlor where two
coffins rest. Thomas and Martha Wayne. Dead leaves whip
through the hallway.

SMALL HANDS touch a leather bound book. Suddenly the
pages are splattered with blood. Wind blows out two
flickering candles.

THE BOY runs through a dark, stormy night, the book
clutched in his hands. He slips. A sinkhole.

A FALL down a narrow chute. The boy lands in a dark cave.

A GIANT MONARCH BAT, fangs bared, SCREECHES towards us.

TWO-FACE (V.O.)
You're a killer too.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

In his bed, Bruce wakes, trying to blink away the images.
Alfred draws the curtains, welcoming rich autumn sun.

ALFRED
The dreams again, sir?

BRUCE
I think they're getting worse.

ALFRED
It's a wonder you sleep at all.

As Bruce sits up, Alfred notices a fresh set of bruises.

ALFRED
What a marvelous shade of purple.

Bruce shoots him a look.

ALFRED
Really, sir, if you insist on trying
to get yourself killed each night.

Alfred picks up Bruce's carelessly-tossed Batsuit from
the floor. Ripped, dented, punctured.

ALFRED
...Would it be a terrible imposition
to ask you to take better care of
your equipment?

BRUCE
Then you'd have nothing to complain
about.

ALFRED
Hardly a worry, sir.

Alfred brings a robe, holds it out for Bruce.

ALFRED
Commissioner Gordon phoned. There's
been an accident at Wayne
Enterprises.

INT. - WAYNE ENTERPRISES - MORNING

As the window is replaced in b.g., Edward Nygma stands
SOBBING before the head of personnel. With augmented
brain power apparently comes augmented acting talent.

EDWARD
(inconsolable)
Why? Oh, why? I can't believe it.
Two years. Working in the same
office. Shoulder to shoulder, cheek
to cheek, ---we're talking face, by
the way---and then this.
(handing her a note)
I found this in my cubicle. You'll
find the handwriting matches his
exactly as does sentence structure
and spelling.

(suddenly sobbing again)
I couldn't possibly continue on
here. The memories. I'll just get my
things.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Edward slips out a side door, quickly avoiding Bruce and
Gordon as they walk towards Bruce's office.

GORDON
We've questioned everyone who worked
on the floor. Computer records show
no one going in or out after
Stickley.

BRUCE
Computer records can be forged.
I'll have my people pull up --

A cop hands Gordon the forged note.

GORDON
Suicide. With all due respect, leave
the police work to us. We'll be in
touch.

As the Commissioner exits, Bruce heads into his office,
followed by his secretary, MARGARET.

INT. BRUCE'S OFFICE (CONTINUOUS)

MARGARET
The society matrons of Gotham have
called a record thirty-two times.
Not to mention the press. I think
that if they don't know soon who you
plan to take to the charity circus,
the world will most surely come to
an end.

Bruce notices an envelope on his desk.

BRUCE
What's this?

MARGARET
I don't know. I didn't see anyone...

BRUCE
No postmark. No stamp.

Bruce opens the envelope.

LETTER - CLOSE. A photo of Bruce. Below: letters cut from
newspapers and magazines read:

(RIDDLE#1) (to be written)
signed -The Riddler

Bruce raises an eyebrow.

BRUCE
The Riddler? Why can't anyone in
this town have a normal name?

Phone RINGS. Bruce hits a switch and a desk video-phone
lights into life. Alfred.

ALFRED
Channel 12, sir.

Bruce presses a button and Alfred's image shrinks to a
small box in the corner, superimposed atop a TV picture.

ON SCREEN -

A talk show in progress. A radiant black host: VONDELLE
MILLIONS talks to a panel of experts.

VONDELLE
--joined us, we're talking about the
mutilation of Lady Gotham, caused
late last night by Batman-

BRUCE
_Excuse_ me?!

VONDELLE
-- will take up to nine months to
repair. Today's topic: Batman-crime-
fighter or criminal?

BATMAN
How 'bout Two-Face? Anyone here
heard of him?

The shot WIDENS to reveal the panel.

ON SCREEN - Our first expert: DR. JANISLAUS ROYCE.

ROYCE
Batman is a major cause of crime in
Gotham. So-called super-villains
seek him out hoping to prove
themselves in violent conflict.
Batman does not deter crime, he
invites it.

VONDELLE
I'm sure our audience objects to
your gender bias. Batperson.

The second expert PIPES in, DR. DAVID AIMS.

AIMS
What is the Dark Knight's credo?
Batman does not kill? What of those
slain during his fight with Jack
Napier aka Joker? Or in his
Christmas conflict with the orphan
Cobblepot? Batman belongs behind
bars, not his morally disadvantaged
victims.

CHASE (O.S.)

Bull (bleep)!

WIDER

Chase sits at the end of the panel.

VONDELLE
What did you say?

CHASE
Which part of the word didn't you
understand?

Watching, Bruce sits a little straighter, more hopeful.

BRUCE
I could like this woman.

CHASE
Batman is a _reaction_ to the crime in
this city, not a creator of it!
Without him many more would be dead.
Batman is a true hero...

VONDELLE
Hey, Doc, got the hots for Batman?

HOOTS and HOLLERS from the audience.

CHASE - CLOSE. Busted.

On screen, a graphic: BATMAN: CRIMEFIGHTER OR CRIMINAL?

VONDELLE
What do you think? Call us at...

A HAND reaches up and SNAPS off the TV. The screen goes
black to reveal a reflection in the glass: Two-Face.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT. TWO-FACE'S HIDEOUT - DAY

Two-Face turns away, disgusted.

TWO-FACE
Batman, Batman, Batman. God, we want
that man's blood on our hands.

WIDER

LEATHER sits to one side of Harvey. Ruby lipstick, tight
leather outfit, a choker o spikes, razor blade earrings,
stroking a muzzled black doberman.

LEATHER
Oh you are most obscene, my
frightful grotesque.

Another set of arms entwine Two-Face.

LACE, a submissive blonde in Victoria's Secret's lacy
best nuzzles his good side, pets a white kitten.

LACE
Don't listen to her. You're every
girl's dream.

LEATHER
Waste Dorothy and Toto here, you and
me can get down to business.

Harvey SLAPS Leather, hard.

LEATHER
Harder, baby. Hit me again.

TWO-FACE
No.
LEATHER
(hotter still)
Sadist.

He turns now to Lace, caresses her face gently.

WIDEN TO REVEAL

Two-Face's hideaway, divided straight down the middle.
Lace's half is all light and order. Leather's domain
looks like an S&M club.

TWO-FACE
Too many bats to fry to think about
fun. We wanna take him apart limb by
hyper-extended limb. Feel his bones
crunch in our hands. Beat him until
he's as black and blue as that
ridiculous rubber suit.

Without thinking, Harvey steps over the Laceland. His
demeanor instantly changes, now more reasoned and calm.

TWO-FACE
On the other hand, perhaps something
slow, a delicious incursion of
despair, a campaign to shatter his
psyche and bring him crumbling to
his knees.

He wanders back across to Leatherland.

TWO-FACE
Hell. Why wait? Rupture his organs.
Shatter his spine. Still have time
for a late dinner.

Back in Laceland.

TWO-FACE
But simple murder? It's just too
damn simple. Besides, it's been
done. No. We need a plan.

Back to Leatherland.

TWO-FACE
Yes. Something senseless, brutal,
savage, violent.

Back to Laceland, stopping to add...
TWO-FACE
Yet witty.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Edward peddles a bicycle down a service road towards
Wayne Manor, an envelope jutting from his shirt pocket.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Alfred stands over a cage of bats. A hand-held scanner
producing distance readings.

Bruce sits before his Master Console.

BRUCE
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?

ALFRED
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident
we'll have a prototype in no time.

BRUCE
It'll never work.

ALFRED
I believe you said the same thing
about the Batmobile.

(OVER) a doorbell RINGS. Alfred disappears upstairs.

BRUCE - OVER THE SHOULDER

Bruce works a keyboard, manipulating the images on
various screens.

SCREEN ONE - Replays the CNN story on Two-Face

SCREEN TWO - Replays the Vondelle Williams show.

SCREEN THREE - Runs news footage of Chase.

As Alfred returns, Bruce splits the Chase screen, a list
of psychiatric texts scrolling beside her portrait.

ALFRED
Scholarly research?

BRUCE
She has an excellent mind.

ALFRED
If I misinterpreted your interest in
the lady, I humbly apologize--

BRUCE
I wonder if she'd go out with me.

ALFRED
Apology hastily retracted.

Bruce freezes the image of Vondelle Williams over the
familiar graphic: Batman: Crimefighter or Criminal?

BRUCE
They don't understand. They think I
became Batman to fight crime.

Bruce leans back, closes his eyes, his past never far.

BRUCE
Do you remember the night I fell
into that cave and the bat chased
me?

ALFRED
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like
tears.

BRUCE
...The night Batman was born.
(a beat)
What was I doing in the fields that
night, Alfred? What sent me running
out into that storm? I keep dreaming
about it but I just can't remember.

ALFRED
I don't know, sir. Your dear
parents. Suddenly gone. So much
loss...

BRUCE
I remember the bat, though. His
scream. Those eyes. i was sure the
fear would kill me.
(a beat)
In time I came to believe that if I
became a monster, that if I was
feared, I wouldn't be scared
anymore. I was wrong.
(off the screen)
They think I became Batman to fight
crime. I became Batman to fight the
fear. And instead I became the fear.

Alfred hands him an envelope.

ALFRED
Perhaps it's time you paid a bit
more attention to Bruce Wayne. There
was no one at the door, just this.

Within, (RIDDLE #2). His expression darkens.

EXT. UGLY TENEMENT - BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

(OVER) SOUNDS OF POUNDING

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE EDWARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The source of the POUNDING -- MRS. LUCERTOLA, Ed's
middle-aged, no-bullshit landlady.

MRS. LUCERTOLA
Ya wanna cough up your rent, or do I
post an eviction notice?

Locks TURN. The door opens a crack. Edward peeks out.

EDWARD
Mrs. Lucertola. What a surprise.
Come in. I was just sitting down to
write the check.

INT. EDWARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mrs. Lucertola barges inside -- then stops, aghast.

HER POV-

Five people might live here. Sports magazines. Stock
market tickers. Half completed paintings and sculptures.
Blueprints. In the corner an old circus booth containing
a manikin of the green-clad, can wielding Guesser.

MRS. LUCERTOLA
What is it exactly that you do, Mr.
Nygma?

EDWARD
My dear Ms. Lucertola. Italian,
isn't it? For lizard. How fitting. I
think the question better asked:
what is it that I don't do?

Ed guides Mrs. Lucertola to a sofa before the TV.

EDWARD
Most recently I have devised a way
to change the destiny of mankind and
the world as we know it, all in my
favor of course.

MRS. LUCERTOLA
The rent Nygma!!!

EDWARD
Might I persuade you to take a seat
on this couch? To indulge me in a
little experiment?

He shoves her down.

MRS. LUCERTOLA
Hey, I got no time for-

Edward clamps a new, streamlined headband on her head.

EDWARD
Showtime.

He clicks on the TV. An evening soap.

MRS. LUCERTOLA
My favorite story.

Atop the TV rests a small box. The next generation of his
Remote Encephalographic Stimulator.

EDWARD
Yes. TV. Balm to the minds of the
masses. The great deadener. If only
it were more lively. But wait. I can
help.

He hits a switch on the Box and the familiar beam engulfs
his landlady, the holographic image of the screen's
kissing couple now hovering in mid-air before her.

MRS. LUCERTOLA
Oh my lord.

EDWARD
Not quite. But I'm getting there.

MRS. LUCERTOLA - POV - She might as well be sitting on the
foot of the bed as the two lovers' embrace heats up.

Edward waves his hand in front of her eyes. Nothing. The
same dazed expression that Stickley wore.

EDWARD
Now this is much better. No pain.
Just a little holographic TV to keep
your mind off the fact...

Edward PLANTS an ELECTRODE on his forehead.

EDWARD
...That I'm taking your mind.
(professional)
Not your thoughts, mind you. Just
your neural energy, simply sucking
some IQ points as it were.

A GREEN-BLUE aura forms around Edward's head.

EDWARD
(announcer)
His intelligence jumps. Ms. Lizard
don't know it. The crowd goes wild.
(CEO)
Boys, I want one of these babies in
every home.
(Clinton)
It's the new information super
highway and, pay attention now kids.
I'm the on ramp.
(ad-man)
From their brains to the TV to my
brain, with no commercial
interruptions!
(announcer)
There are seven million brains in
the Naked City...
(menacing)
...and they're all mine!

EXT. MUNICIPAL POLICE COMPLEX - DAY

Gothic. Active. Bruce enters the complex.

INT. POLICE COMPLEX - CHASE'S OFFICE

Comfortable. Well appointed. Degrees on the walls.

Chase opens her door to Bruce Wayne.

CHASE
Mr. Wayne. Chase Meridian.

The sparks he felt from her as Batman don't fly.

CHASE
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?

BRUCE
Somebody's been sending me love
letters. Commissioner Gordon thought
you might give me your expert
opinion.

Chase spread the `Riddler' letters before her. Bruce
TAPS his fingers absentmindedly as he watches her read.

CHASE
Psychiatrists make you nervous?

BRUCE
Just ones this beautiful.

CHASE
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it
ever shut off?

BRUCE
On occasion. Usually at night.

Bruce stops tapping, examines books on aberrant behavior.
The Dark Side. Turns a tiny wicker doll over in his hand.

BRUCE
Still play with dolls, Doctor?

CHASE
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She
stands sentry while you sleep and
calms your dreams.
(off Bruce's expressions)
Need one?

BRUCE
Me? No. Only things that need
calming in my dreams are the
Rockettes.

Chase holds his eyes a beat. Not buying. But she lets it
go, looks back over the letters.

CHASE
My opinion. This letter writer is a
total wacko.

BRUCE
Wacko? That a technical term?

CHASE
Patient apparently suffers from
acute obsessional syndrome with
potential homicidal styles. Work
better for you?

BRUCE
So what you're saying, this guy's a
total wacko, right?

CHASE
(a slight smile)
Exactly.

He notices batman research on her desk. Spots a framed
print hanging on the wall. A bat.

BRUCE
You have a thing for bats?

Chase follows his gaze.

CHASE
That's a rorschach, Mr. Wayne.
People see what they want to.

Bruce looks back up. In fact, just an ink blot. Only he
saw a bat within it's bleeding lines.

CHASE
I think the question would be, do
you have a thing for bats?

BRUCE
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?

CHASE
What do you know about obsession?

BRUCE
Not much.

CHASE

Obsession is born of fear. Recall a
moment of great terror in your life.
Say you associate that moment
with...
(random)
...a bat. The bat's image becomes a
cancer of the mind, grows more real
than your daily life. Can you
imagine something like that?

BRUCE
It's a stretch but I'll manage.

CHASE
The letter writer is obsessed with
you. His only escape may be...

BRUCE
To kill me.

CHASE
You understand obsession better than
you let on.

BRUCE
No insights here, doc. Just trying
to get comfortable on your couch.
(checking his watch)
Oops. Times up.

CHASE
That's usually my line.

BRUCE
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-

CHASE
Would you? I'm not so sure.

BRUCE
But I'm going to have to get you out
of those clothes.

CHASE
Excuse me.

BRUCE
And into a black dress.

Bruce throws her startled expression his best smile.

BRUCE
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the
circus?

Despite herself, Chase smiles back.

A SIGN - CLOSE - Gotham Hospital Charity Circus.

WIDER

EXT. HIPPODROME - NIGHT

Immense. On the lapping edge of Gotham Harbor.

Searchlights sweep the sky. FLAGS flutter on the
Hippodrome's oval roof, Limos spill Gotham's finest. The
night of the season.

INT. CENTER RING

THE FLYING GRAYSONS -- Mother, Father, and two sons all
wearing colorful red and green outfits with yellow cape-
-- race out to greet the crowd. They discard their capes,
cartwheel to four guywires.

RINGMASTER
Ladies and gentlemen. Seventy feet
above the ground, performing feats
of aerial skill without a net, the
Flying Graysons!

The lights dim. Spots follow each Grayson as hoist cables
whisk them up to the trapezes and high wire.

ON THE TRAPEZE

Dad and Chris Grayson hang by their knees, upside down on
opposite trapezes.

Mom jumps to Chris' hands, hangs in mid-air. Chris swings
back and forth, building momentum, then sends her to Dad
in a poetic double somersault.

BELOW

The Hippodrome is packed solid.

VIP SECTION

Bruce and Chase in evening finery take their seats amidst
a barrage of flashing photographers. The Gotham Society
matrons crowd for a photo op.

CHASE
(off the flashes)
I'm surprised you aren't blind by
now.

BRUCE
(as if he were)
I'm sorry. Who are you?

Chase smiles. The Press and Matrons disappear.

BRUCE
Now we can just sit back and watch
the show like normal folks.

RINGMASTER (OVER)
Tonight's benefit has raised
$375,000 for Gotham Children's
Hospital. Let's thank our largest
single donor: Bruce Wayne.

SPOTLIGHT finds Bruce and Chase. WILD APPLAUSE.

CHASE
(through her smile)
Like normal folks.

BRUCE
(deadpan)
What? This isn't normal?

RINGMASTER
And now Richard, the youngest Flying
Grayson, will perform The _Quadruple_
Flying Somersault!

DICK GRAYSON, handsome, only happy when he is in flight,
jumps to his father's hands, hangs in air.

DICK'S POV - The world flips, dizzying, four times.

Chris catches Dick's hands. Shaky. One hand slips free.
The Crowd GASPS. Dick dangles for an instant.

Chris hoists Dick to safety. An uproarious OVATION!

CHASE watches Bruce. He's riveted, eyes like a child's.

BRUCE
That kid is amazing.

CHASE
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.

BRUCE
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a
couple of martinis.

CHASE
The glib, cavalier routine, it
really is an act, isn't it?

BRUCE
Don't believe it. I'm just skin
deep.

But he holds her eyes and in the smile that passes
between them, sweet electricity. Maybe something more.

THE RINGMASTER stands watching the Graysons feats of
aerial wonder. Something catches his eye.

A GLOVED HAND extends through the curtain leading
backstage, beckons him with a single finger.

THE RINGMASTER - CLOSE. Puzzled. Steps out of the ring.

BACK TO BRUCE AND CHASE

BRUCE
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How
about coming along?

CHASE
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem
like a really great guy...

BRUCE
But...

CHASE
Well, I met someone...

BRUCE
Fast work. You just moved here.

CHASE
You could say he kind of dropped out
of the sky and bang-. I think he
felt it too.

BRUCE
He sure did.

CHASE
What?

BRUCE
(awkward)
I said I'm sure he did.

Bruce looks towards...

CENTER RING

A TINY CAR, horn HONKING away, ROARS into the middle ring
and begins dislodging clowns, all tumbling out of the
cars and over each other.

A new Ringmaster steps into the arena. Two-Face.

TWO-FACE
Ladies and gentlemen, and I do use
the term loosely, your attentions
please. Tonight, a new act for your
amusement. We call it Massacre Under
the Big Top.

His thugs slip out of their clown costumes and seal every
exit.

They pull machine guns and start SHOOTING over the
audience's heads. PANIC. SCREAMS.

TWO-FACE
People, people. Show some grace
under pressure. A little decorum,
please.
(into his mike)
_SHUT UP_!!!

More machine gun BURSTS as Thugs move into sentry
positions at each section of bleachers. Folks quiet.

TWO-FACE
If we may direct your attention...

/90 A Thug trains a spot on a crate hung in the rafters. 189/

TWO-FACE
Inside that wooden box: two hundred
sticks of TNT.
(showing a box)
In our hand: a radio detonator.

Two-Face presses a button.

DETONATOR - CLOSE. A digital countdown. 3:00. 2:59. 2:58...

TWO-FACE
You have three minutes.

THE MAYOR
What the hell do you want?

TWO-FACE
Want, Mr. Mayor? Just one little
thing. Batman. Bruised. Broken.
Bleeding. In a word: dead.

Two-Face turns, showing his good side.

TWO-FACE
Who do we have assembled before us?
Gotham's finest. Rich, Influential.
Smart. One of you must know who
Batman is. Hell, we'd lay odds one
of you _is_ Batman.

Two-Face spins, offers his evil side.

TWO-FACE
So, unless the bat is surrendered to
us post haste, we're off on a
proverbial killing spree. City wide
mayhem and murder. Starting tonight.
With all you lovely folks as our
very first corpses to be. You have
three ---well just under three---
minutes.

BRUCE, his eyes riveted on the bomb. No secret is worth
innocent lives. He stands.

Chase, misunderstanding, tries to pull Bruce back down.

WIDER

Suddenly everyone jumps up, SHOUT and SCREAM, point
towards the rafters.

REVERSE ANGLE

The Graysons scale the scaffolding, heading for the bomb.

TWO-FACE
Boys! Move, move, move!
(a beat)
Cannot get good help these days.

Any Thugs not standing sentry fan out, speed up guywires.

CHRIS
(to Dick)
Go! We'll hold them off!

Mom, Dad and Chris swing from trapeze to guywire to
platform, trying to delay the Thugs who are actually
well-trained gymnasts.

Dick launches himself from trapeze to trapeze, bounces
off the high wire, grabs a catwalk and hoists himself up.

Bruce uses the distraction to hop the rail, race through
the SCREAMING CROWD.

THE TIME - CLOSE. 1:03. 1:02. 1:01.

ON THE TRAPEZE

A Thug grabs Dad Grayson by the leg. Dad manages a jump
to another trapeze.

Mom's not so lucky. A Thug punches her off the uppermost
platform. She falls in mid-air.

FOLKS in the audience SCREAM.

BRUCE moves fast towards one of the sentry Thugs.

MOM snags a wildly swinging trapeze with one leg, wraps
her ankle around a rope, hanging over the floor.

A THUG points to the Time Clock 0:45. 0:44. 0:43.

THE THUGS quit the fight, slide down ropes and guywires.

DAD AND CHRIS form a human chain to reach Mom. Dad
anchors Chris who swings out towards Mom. Mom swings her
trapeze to gather momentum.

IN THE RAFTERS

Dick has reached the Bomb. Begins un-lashing the crate.

ON THE CIRCUS FLOOR

The Thugs begin to pour through the trap door. A few
thrill-seekers fire their MACHINE GUNS over the crowd.

THE TIMER - CLOSE. 0:15. 0:14. 0:13.

DICK scales a service ladder, vies with a roof hatch.

TRAPEZE - CLOSE

Dan and Chris make their final swing. Mom lets go and
sails gloriously towards Chris. Below them, no net.

BRUCE taps the watching Thug on the shoulder. He spins.

BRUCE
Show's over.

A punch and the guy is out. Bruce starts for Two-Face.
Another Thug springs up before him, blocking his way.

TWO-FACE stares up at the dangling Graysons. He reaches
into his pocket. Pulls out a familiar coin.

TWO-FACE
Day in, day out, it always comes
down to the same old question.
Life...
(flips the coin)
Or death.

He looks down. Scarred side up. He draws his gun.

TWO-FACE
Our kinda day.

BRUCE fells the other Thug. Starts to sprint across the
ring towards Two-Face.

AT THE ROOF

Dick shoves the hatch open, climbs out.

TIMER - CLOSE. 0:10. 0:09. 0:08.

MOM spots the pointing gun far below. She SCREAMS.

BRUCE races for the aiming Two-Face. Almost there.
Another Thug hits him broadside, knocking him flat.

TWO-FACE FIRES. Twice, the first bullet cutting, the
second severing the rope that holds the Graysons.

TWO-FACE
Never did like the circus. Too many
freaks.

/27 Two-Face disappears down the tunnel. Bruce struggles 226/
to his feet. A CHARGE blows inside the escape hatch,
filling the access-way with fire. No way out.

CLOCK - CLOSE. 0:07. 0:06.

EXT. HIPPODROME ROOF - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Dick scrambles onto the roof, begins whipping the bomb
rope like a sling.

INT. HIPPODROME - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

CLOCK - CLOSE. 0:05. 0:04. 0:03.

EXT. HIPPODROME ROOF - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Dick let's fly, the bomb soaring out towards the harbor.

THE BOMB hits the water. Sinks. A beat. The night is
split by a funneling EXPLOSION.

INT. HIPPODROME - NIGHT

Dick swings excitedly down onto the catwalk. He freezes
at the rail.

DICK
No!!!!

DICK - CLOSE. On his face, his life's end.

DICK'S POV -- STRAIGHT DOWN

The dead bodies of his mother, father and brother. Bruce
Wayne stands over them, looking up at the boy.

BRUCE - CLOSE. His face a tragic echo of Dick's pain.

EXT. - WAYNE MANOR - NEXT AFTERNOON

A police car heads towards the manor. Dick Grayson, pack
on his back, winds his motorcycle behind the cruiser.

Bruce comes out to greet Gordon. Dick, slightly
awestruck, dismounts, wanders into the house.

GORDON
It's good of you to take him in.
He's been filling out forms all day.
He hasn't even eaten.

Bruce nods, watches Gordon drive off. Heads into...

INT. WAYNE MANOR FOYER - LATE DAY

As Bruce ENTERS through the open door, Alfred arrives
from the other direction.

ALFRED
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.

DICK
How ya doin', Al?

ALFRED
(mouthing)
Al?

DICK
(to Bruce)
Big house. How many rooms?

BRUCE
Gee, I'm not sure.
(across the foyer)
Alfred? How many rooms? Total?

ALFRED
Ninety-three, including the sauna.

BRUCE
Take any three you like. After you
get settled we can...

/39 But Dick isn't listening, stares instead over 238/
Bruce's shoulder as Gordon's cruiser disappears out of
sight.

DICK
Okay. I'm outta here.

BRUCE
Excuse me.

DICK
I figure telling that cop I'd stay
here saved me a truckload of social
service interviews and good will. So
no offense but thanks. See ya.

Dick heads toward the door. Alfred slips away.

BRUCE
Where will you go? The circus is
halfway to Metropolis by now.

DICK
I got no place at the circus without
my family. I'm going to get a fix on
Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill
him.

BRUCE
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't
take the pain away. It'll make it
worse.

DICK
Look, spare me the sermons, okay.
You're just some rich guy who is
trying to do a good deed. You don't
even know me.

Bruce stares beyond Dick, into his own past.

BRUCE
It's not just the sadness. Is it?
The shame is worse. Feeling like
somehow you should have saved them.

Dick is looking at Bruce now.

BRUCE
You're right. I don't know you. But
I'm like you.

Just then Alfred returns with a tray. Rare London broil.
Baby potatoes. Fresh greens. An aromatic feast.

ALFRED
Oh, is the young master leaving?
Pity. I'll just toss this away then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry -

Alfred turns, heads up the stairs.

ALFRED
I'll set this up in the guest suite.
Just in case.

Dick follows, led by his nose.

Bruce smiles, nods slowly, heads into...

INT. - WAYNE LIBRARY

Bruce touches a vase of fresh roses. Stares at framed
photos of Thomas, Martha, of himself, younger. Happy.
With no knowledge of the future.

He turns. Suddenly their coffins are in the middle of the
room again, the still corpses white in death. He's a
boy.

There on the desk. A leather bound book. (OVER) THUNDER
CRACKS.

THE FRONT DOOR flies open. An evil wind whips the house.

THE BOOK is splattered with blood.

THE WINDOW explodes, shattering glass, and out of the
darkness flies a huge, evil bat.

ALFRED (OVER)
Master Bruce?

Bruce is sitting in a chair, holding a rose, head down,
the images only flashes of memory. Night has fallen. He
looks up, eyes. red.

BRUCE
It's happening again. Just like my
parents. A monster comes out of the
night. A scream. Two gunshots. I
killed them.

ALFRED
What did you say?

BRUCE
He killed them. Two-Face. He
slaughtered that boy's parents.

ALFRED
No. You said I. I killed them.

BRUCE
Don't be ridiculous.

Suddenly a pale light through the window illuminates the
room, bathes their faces.

THE BATSIGNAL beams in the sky.

INT. GUEST (DICK'S) BEDROOM

Dick Grayson finishes eating. He moves into the

HALLWAY

the house seems empty.

DICK
Hey?.. Hello?... Anybody home?

He's puzzled.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY STREET - NIGHT

Batman speeds along in the Batmobile. He hits top speed
as the car's fusion drive glows red.

A giant projector, beaming the Batsignal on the fast
night clouds. Batman leaps from a neighboring roof to
find no one. Just the huge light and the city wind.

BATMAN
Commissioner...?

A shadow appears from behind the searchlight. Chase.

CHASE
He's home. I sent the signal.

BATMAN
What's wrong?

CHASE
Last night at the circus. I noticed
something about Dent. His coin. He's
obsessed with justice. It's his
Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.

He steps close to her. Intimidating.

BATMAN
You called me here for this? The
Batsignal is not a beeper.

Instead of backing off, Chase moves towards him.

CHASE
I wish I could say my interest in
you was purely professional...

BATMAN
Are you trying to get under my cape,
Doctor?

CHASE
A girl cannot live by psychoses
alone.

BATMAN
It's the car, right? Chicks love the
car.

CHASE
What is it about the wrong kind of
man? In grade school it was guys
with earrings. College, motorcycles
and leather jackets.

Chase is right up against him. She runs her fingers along
the outline of Batman's mask.

CHASE
Now black rubber.

BATMAN
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

CHASE
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't
see behind the mask.

Batman stills her hand.

BATMAN
We all wear masks.

CHASE
My life's an open book. You read?

BATMAN
I'm not the kind of guy who blends
in at a family picnic.

CHASE
We could give it a try. I'll bring
the wine, you bring the scarred
psyche.

BATMAN
You are direct, aren't you?

CHASE
You like strong women. I've done my
homework. Or do I need skin-tight
vinyl and a whip?

Their bodies are close.

BATMAN
I haven't had much luck with
women...

CHASE
Maybe you just haven't met the right
woman...

Their mouths are close. Suddenly Commissioner Gordon,
trench-coat over pajamas, rushes onto the roof.

GORDON
I saw the beacon. What's going on?

BATMAN
Nothing... False alarm.

Batman shoots a Batarang into the night and dives from
the building.

CHASE
Are you sure?

EXT. SEEDY PART OF TOWN - DAY

SIRENS WHINE as two cruisers fly down a pot-holed street.

ANGLE ON - A bridge structure.

INT. TWO-FACE'S HIDEOUT - DAY

The room is dark. POLICE SIRENS FADE as a trap door opens
in the floor. Two-Face emerges.

TWO-FACE
Ever have one of those days where
you just want to kill someone?

VOICE IN THE DARK
Riddle me this. (Riddle #3)

REVERSE ANGLE

A mysterious silhouette stands in the dark.

Two-Face draws his gun.

VOICE IN THE DARK
The answer is, your enemy.

TWO-FACE
Who are you?

VOICE IN THE DARK
You can just call me... The Riddler.

The figure steps out of shadow. A new costume, lime
green, covered with question marks, an emerald eye mask,
derby and cane. An exact replica of the Guesser's outfit.

TWO-FACE
How'd you find us?

RIDDLER
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to
face both rivers, both uptown and
downtown simultaneously. Only one
spot in Gotham serves these bi-
zonal, bi-coastal needs...

TWO-FACE
Congratulations. You get to die on
the dean's list.

Two-Face trains his gun, COCKS the trigger.

RIDDLER
Has anyone ever told you have a
serious impulse control problem?
(looking around)
You know, I simply love what you've
done with this place. Heavy Metal
with just a touch of House and
Garden.

He crosses to Leatherland.

RIDDLER
It's so dark and Gothic and
disgustingly decadent...

He moves to Laceland.

RIDDLER
Yet so bright and chipper and
conservative!
(to "bad" side)
It's so you.
("good" side)
And yet so _you_!
(touching his suit)
Very few people are both a summer
_and_ a winter. But you pull it off
nicely.

TWO-FACE
A man with a death wish.

RIDDLER
Harvey. You need me. Since you've
gotten out of Arkham, you've
managed, what? To bungle stealing a
safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct
me if I'm wrong here, but weren't
you outsmarted by an acned acrobat
at the circus?

TWO-FACE
Let's see if you bleed green.

Two-Face COCKS back the hammer.

RIDDLER
Alright, counselor. Go ahead. Fire
away. But before you do, let me ask
you one question. Is it really me
you want to kill?

The Riddler knits his thumbs together, waves his hands
over one of the exposed light bulbs that illuminate the
room, making a shadow on the wall. The shadow of a bat.

RIDDLER
Do you know about hate, my dual
visaged friend? Slow, burning hate
that keeps you sleepless until late
in the night, that wakes you before
dawn. Do you know that kind of hate?
I do.
(circling Harvey)
Kill him? Seems like a good enough
idea. But have you thought it
through? A few bullets, a quick
spray of blood, a fast, thrilling
rush, and then what? Wet hands and
post-coital depression. Is it really
enough?
(up close)
Why not ruin him first? Expose his
frailty. And then, when he is at his
weakest, crush him in your hand.

Riddler gestures to the front of the room, where Leather
and Lace, on their respective sides, are fixed to their
TV's via the green beam of the box.

He tosses a receiver electrode to Two-Face.

RIDDLER
...Take a hit.

Two-Face looks at the electrode curiously.

RIDDLER
(taps his forehead)
Up, up, up.

A beat. Then, gun still trained on the Riddler, Two-Face
holds the receiver to his skull. He's blasted with a dose
of Leather and Lace's neural energy.

TWO-FACE
Holy shit.

RIDDLER
So not everyone can be a poet.
Still, I respect the sentiment.

Riddler waves his hand in front of the girls' eyes. No
response. Definitely zoned.

RIDDLER
(to the girls)
This is your brain on the box.
(off Harvey)
This is your brain on their brain.

He plants an electrode on his own forehead.

RIDDLER
This is my brain on your brain on
their brain. Does anybody else feel
like a fried egg?

The Riddler grabs Two-Face's receiver.

TWO-FACE
No. Wait...

RIDDLER
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No.
Until I say yes. A little fringe
benefit of working with me. Now
here's the concept, counselor.
Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help
me gather production capital so I
can produce enough of these
(pulling a Box from his vest)
to create an empire that will
eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And,
in return I will help you solve the
greatest riddle of all. Who is
Batman?

Two-Face eyes The Riddler, interest dawning in his eyes.

TWO-FACE
You are a very strange person. You
speak as if we are old friends,
which we are not. You barge in here
unarmed when it is clearly suicidal
to do so. Still, an intriguing
proposition.
(pulling his coin)
Heads: we take your offer.

He rests the barrel on The Riddler's temple.

TWO-FACE
Tails: we blow your _goddamned head
off_!

FOLLOW THE COIN

as Two-Face FLIPS it high in the air... SPINNING...

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE

Thugs grab handfuls of gems as a Guard presses the ALARM
BUTTON. LOONY TOONS and MERRIE MELODIES THEMES play as
Riddler's animated face fills the surveillance screens.

WIDER

The Riddler and Two-Face stand over a palette of black
jeweler's felt. Littered with bright, sparkling diamonds.

The Riddler slips on a monocle, lifts a stone.

Two-Face grabs the entire palette, pours the diamonds
into a loot bag, heads towards another counter.

INT. BATMOBILE - MOVING

WINDSCREEN - CLOSE. A flashing message: Crime In Progress.

An ever changing tactical map shows Batman's narrowing
proximity to the crime site.

EXT. STREET

The Batmobile rushes to a halt. Batman leaps out, SMASHES
through a door into...

INT. BEAUTY SALON

...Girls LAUGH and flirt. Even behind his mask, Batman
fumes. Obviously misled.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Bruce sits watching the news.

ANCHOR
...working with Two-Face, Gotham's
new criminal mastermind is calling
himself The Riddler. Twenty million
in diamonds were stolen yesterday
with no sign of Batman.

SCREEN - CLOSE. Changes. Edward stands on the Claw Island.
A small abandoned island in Gotham Harbor.

ANCHOR
In other news, entrepreneur Edward
Nygma has signed a lease for Claw
Island. Nygma says he plans to break
ground on an electronics plant....

EXT. ARMORED TRUCK BASE

Armored trucks sit open on the street. Two-toned thugs
carry out bags of loot.

Two-Face and the Riddler stand before four guards, each
sentry held captive by a two-toned crony.

TWO-FACE
Close your fist. Reach back.

Two-Face swings, clocks the guard on the chin. CRACK. Out
like a light.

TWO-FACE
Get it?

Riddler nods tentatively. Manages a weak fist. Throws a
feeble punch. The Guard looks barely startled.

TWO-FACE
Riddler. You punch like a girl. Put
some heart into it.

Two-Face hauls off, hits the third Guard. Out he goes.

RIDDLER
Okay. Okay. I got it.

He leans way back, tries again. Barely a glancing blow.

TWO-FACE
My God.

He walks away, shaking his head, disgusted. The Riddler
turns back to the guard. Ready for another try.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - HALLWAY

NEWSPAPER - CLOSE. RIDDLER & TWO-FACE TERRORIZE GOTHAM.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Alfred, newspaper in hand, finds Dick trying to open the
door which leads to the Bat Cave.

ALFRED
May I help you, Master Grayson?

DICK
How come this is the only locked
door around this museum? What's back
there?

ALFRED
Master Wayne's dead wives.

Dick grins. Alfred watches him go, a wry smile on his
face. The coast now clear, he disappears into the secret
doorway.

WIDER

Dick stands hidden in an alcove, watching.

EXT. CLAW ISLAND - DAY

Tremendous construction in progress.

INT. CLAW ISLAND

Silhouettes of robot arms manufacture the Box.

Edward watches on, giving Two-Face a quick hit from a
glowing electrode, then snatches back the receiver.

Harvey eyes the electrode with an addict's hungry eyes.

EXT. GOTHAM LOADING DOCK

Two-Face and Thugs steal priceless paintings while the
Guards sit bound and gagged in their booth.

Riddler stares up at a freshly spray-painted (RIDDLE #4)
on the boat's hull.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - LAUNDRY ROOM

Dick stands watching TV while he washes and dries his
clothes using martial arts techniques.

VONDELLE (ON SCREEN)
Has Batman lost his touch? We've
become a city of sissies crying
Batman, Batman, Batman at the first
sign of trouble.

INT. GOTHAM OPERA - NIGHT

The Barber of Seville is in full swing. As the bejewelled
audience watches, the translation is being spelled out
for them on a large electronic screen over the stage.

BACKSTAGE

Green gloved hands attach a Box to the translator.

AUDIENCE

The familiar green beam of The Box transfixes the
audience and the performers. Two-Face and his Thugs take
the balcony in protective green sunglasses, strip folks
of their cash and jewels.

The Riddler stands on stage.

RIDDLER
I just love a captive audience.

He picks up the ARIA A-CAPELLA, races through the stunned
orchestra, collecting valuables.

As he goes, he moves the mouths of his victims, turning
the robbery into an opera of his own.

RIDDLER
(singing)
Oh, but all I want is to take all
your jewels oh oh.
(moving a woman's mouth)
No, oh you villain don't take my
jewels, oh no.
(singing back)
I will.
(a man's mouth)
No you won't.
(singing)
I will.
(another man)
No you won't.

Still SINGING, he leaps back onto the stage where Harvey
and his Thugs arrive, bags full of loot. Riddler plays
tiny hidden buttons in his cane, directing Batman.

TWO-FACE
Where are you sending Batboy this time?

RIDDLER
Here. Get a good seat.

OUT THE WINDOW

The Batmobile makes a quick stop before the opera house.

Riddler, Two-Face and Thugs disappear just as...

BATMAN

drops to the Stage from the ceiling. He looks around at
the stunned audience.

He spots a small box with a question mark on it sitting
center stage. Lifts the top. Within, a pair of plastic
hands applaud him.

THE TRANSLATOR - CLOSE. Vaporizes, the beam snapping off.

THE AUDIENCE

startled by Batman's sudden appearance on stage, starts
LAUGHING. Until someone notices her tiara is missing. A
SCREAM. The first of many.

EXT. GOTHAM TIMES BUILDING - NIGHT

Electronic headlines circles- BAT FLOPS AT OPERA. RIDDLER
AND TWO-FACE STEAL MILLIONS.

EXT. NYGMATECH HEADQUARTERS - CLAW ISLAND - DAY

Finally complete. In the b.g. a giant corporate sign
reading NYGMATECH is raised by cranes.

Edward Nygma, dressed like Bruce Wayne to the smallest
detail, stands on a podium, giving a press conference.

Scores of APPLAUDING Employees and Media watch on. The
Gotham Society Matrons COO.

EDWARD (OVER)
Why sit back when you can be part of
the show?

QUICK CUTS OF NEWSPAPERS

EDWARD (OVER)
...Nygmatech brings the joy 3-D
entertainment into your own home.

CUTS OF MAGAZINES all proclaiming Edward as the new King
of Electronics in Gotham City.

EDWARD
Ladies and gentlemen. Let me tell
you my vision for the future. "The
Box" in every home in America. And
one day, the world.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - MONTAGE

A tenement, where a poor family scrapes together their
savings on a newspaper ad for "The Box"....

An electronics store, where Alfred, at the head of a long
line, hands over a check to receive "The Box"...

A resplendent household where husband, wife, and kids
each watch individual TV's connected to their own Boxes.

INT. NYGMATECH - RIDDLER'S CONTROL ROOM

Riddler sits atop a tremendous electronic throne, facing
a wall bank of TV monitors all running newsreel footage
of folks using "The Box". From overhead, a giant diode
delivers massive pulses of glowing neural energy.

RIDDLER'S HEAD - CLOSE. His brain is growing.

EXT. ELECTRONIC STORES

Crowds of people line up. Some stores say "SOLD OUT"
others "YES, WE HAVE `THE BOX'."

INT. BATCAVE

Bruce stands over the Batcomputer.

BRUCE
Riddler and Two-Face are tweaking
the data before the computer pulls
it off the emergency bands.

Alfred stands in his lab area, trying to disassemble "The
Box". He gets the lid off.

BOX - CLOSE. The circuitry inside automatically vaporizes.

INT. NYGMATECH - EDWARD'S CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

Leather and Lace sit with the Riddler and Two-Face as the
two villains pass an electrode between them.

TWO-FACE
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you
factor in more than three
dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us
again.

RIDDLER
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think
And Drive.

Harvey waves his revolver in Riddler's face.

RIDDLER
Be my guest.

Two-Face and Leather and Lace take another hit of the
glowing neural energy. Smiles.

TWO-FACE
Our Paleolithic yearnings are best
expressed in a pre-linguistic-
(off the befuddled girls)
Sorry. Just thinking out loud.

Harvey leans back, buzzed, the electrode slipping from
his hand. Leather grabs for it. Not fast enough. Riddler
snatches it away.

RIDDLER
(to Leather)
Not until you do that thing I like.
(taking a hit)
On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai
gache ma vie...
(off the electrode)
Woah. Harsh toke.

TWO-FACE
Don't bogart that 'trode.

He tosses Harv the electrode over Lace's ill-timed grab.
Harvey takes a hit.

TWO-FACE
(epiphanous)
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.

RIDDLER
About what?

TWO-FACE
Everything.

RIDDLER & TWO-FACE
(simultaneous)
...Yeah.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

TV - CLOSE.

Vondelle stands before the familiar panel of experts.

AIMS
This Box is nothing more than an
electronic narcotic.

ROYCE
Thousands more Gothamites each day
are tuning out by tuning in to its
holographic fantasies.

AIMS
It's turning citizens into
zombies...

VONDELLE
Gripe, gripe, gripe. Isn't this what
they said about TV? I think "The
Box" is the future. What's your
opinion? I want to know...

FAVOR Alfred as he shuts off the set, moves into the
hallway and the locked door to the Batcave.

ALFRED
(calling out)
Master Dick?

High above, Dick appears on the third floor landing.

DICK
Up here, Al.

ALFRED
Just checking, young sir.

DICK
(to himself)
Four seconds from...

Below, Alfred opens the door.

DICK
Now!

Alfred disappears inside and the door begins to close.

Dick leaps the bannister, grabs the chandelier, swings to
a large tapestry, slides down and into the passageway as
the door SLAMS shut.

INT. SECRET HALL

Unable to stop, Dick barrels through a dark doorway,
tumbles down the long stairway onto

THE BATCAVE FLOOR

Alfred stands in his lab area. The two stare at each
other in utter disbelief.

INT. CHASE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Big. Open. A life still in boxes. The door opens,
producing Bruce and Chase.

BRUCE
The style of the letters I'm getting
matches those found at the crime
sites. Why would The Riddler be
sending me riddles?
(looking around)
Who's your decorator? U-Haul?

CHASE
Sorry. I haven't even had time to
unpack. Instant coffee okay?

Chase disappears into the kitchen as Bruce takes off his
coat. She reappears with a small box. Hands it to Bruce.

BRUCE
What's this?

Bruce opens the box. Within, a dream doll.

CHASE
Call it clinical intuition. I
thought your dreams might need
changing.

Bruce looks at Chase. He stares out the window a beat,
deciding. As he speaks now his words are halting, self
disclosure difficult for him.

BRUCE
My parents were murdered. In front
of me. I was just a kid.

Chase nods. She knows.

BRUCE
A lot of what happened is jagged.
Pieces missing. I can't really
remember. I just get flashes.
Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of
gotten used to them. At least
accepted them....

CHASE
And now....

BRUCE
They've changed. The dreams, I mean.
There's a new element I don't
understand. A book. Black. Covered
in leather....

(OVER) The kettle begins to WHISTLE.

CHASE
Damn. I'll be right back.

Bruce is agitated, starts to looking around. At her desk
he finds a virtual shrine to Batman. Pictures.
Newsphotos. Articles.

CHASE (OVER)
Find anything interesting?

BRUCE
Why do I feel like the other man,
here?

CHASE
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do
for a living.

BRUCE
I'd say this goes a little beyond
taking your work home.

CHASE
What do you want me to say? That I'm
not attracted to him?

She hits a button and on screen newsfootage rolls of
Batman fighting Catwoman.

CHASE
(mesmerized)
Look at the abuse he's taking. He's
not just fighting criminals. He's
punishing himself.

Chase hits a button, freezing on Batman's face.

CHASE
It's as if he's paying some great
penance. What crime could he have
committed to deserve a life sentence
of such agony?

Bruce hits a key, blanking the screen.

BRUCE
Maybe he just had a lousy childhood,
is that it Doc?

Chase grabs his hand as it comes away from the keyboard.

CHASE
Why do you do that?

BRUCE
What?

CHASE
Throw up that ridiculous superficial
mask. If you're jealous...

BRUCE
I'm not-

CHASE
You want me close but you won't let
me near. What's the terrible, dark
secret you're protecting everyone
from?

In the mirror they are half in shadow, half in light.

CHASE
In a sense we are all two people.
The side we show in daylight. And
that side we keep in shadow.

BRUCE
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.

He pulls her to him. Their faces are close. A breath
apart. Suddenly his watch begins to BEEP.

/04 Bruce turns over his wrist. Depresses a stud on 303/
his watch. The face turns into a screen.

ALFRED
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have
some rather distressing news about
Master Dick.

BRUCE
Is he all right?

ALFRED
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone
traveling.

BRUCE
He ran away?

ALFRED
Actually, he took the car.

BRUCE
He boosted the Jag?
(relieved)
Is that all?

ALFRED
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.

BRUCE
The _Rolls_?

ALFRED
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!

A beat. Then Bruce closes his eyes.

EXT. ARKHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

Gotham night life. Neon, traffic, sleaze.

The Batmobile cruises into the center of the strip.

A group of flashy low riders pull in front of the
Batmobile. They hydraulic up and down competitively.

The Batmobile wipers sweep the windshield. The bat-foil
opens and closes. Finally the car hydraulics higher and
faster, but a bit wildly, the driver barely in control.

The low riders, put to shame, PEEL OUT. (OVER) A SCREAM
cuts the night. A GIRL runs for her life, chased by SIX
GANG MEMBERS into a dark alley.

The Batmobile TEARS after her.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

The Thugs have the Girl surrounded, push her back and
forth between them like a rag doll.

The Batmobile SCREECHES into the alley. The door slides
open. From the smoking hatchway emerges...Dick.

Needless to say, this get the Thugs' attention. They let
go of the girl.

THUG
Who the hell are you?

DICK
(low, ominous)
I'm Batman.
(looking down)
Damn, did I forget to dress again?

The Thugs close. One rushes Dick while another swings a
chain at his head. Mistake.

DICK
Chains. You don't seem like the
type.

Dick's hand shoots out fast, grabbing the chain. He open
palms the Thug in the chin, whips the chain into the gut
of the other villain.

DICK
The Caped Crusader strikes again.
Sans cape, of course.

Two more rush him.

DICK
Another victory for the Dark Knight.

Dick goes up with a flying front kick, knocking one down,
fells another on the return with a spinning back fist.

DICK
(off the unconscious goons)
Dark nighty-night.

Dick stares at the remaining thug. Smiles.

DICK
Is your will up to date?

The last Thug takes a look at Dick, turns and races away.

DICK
I could definitely get behind this
super hero gig.

Dick nods to the awestruck Girl.

DICK
Ma'am.

He starts towards the car.

GIRL
Wait.

She moves close.

GIRL
You forgot the part where you kiss
the girl.

DICK
(grinning)
Right.

He leans in, happy to oblige when suddenly...

(OVER) SCREAMS AND SHOUTS as the Thug who got away comes
racing back into the alley, followed by maybe thirty new
gang members, all wielding bats and chains.

DICK
Uh-oh.

He pulls the girl behind him, readies for war.

A DARK FIGURE

flies out of the night.

Batman, on a wire, swings into the group, sending them
scattering in all directions. The bad guys race off.

THE BATMOBILE

REVS UP, races to Batman.

Batman lifts Dick by his collar, drops him into the
passenger seat. Hops into the other side.

GIRL
(shouting)
Don't you want my number?

She watches as the Batmobile speeds away into the night.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT - LATER

Bruce and Dick argue.

DICK
I need to be part of this.

BRUCE
Absolutely not.

DICK
Me and my brother Chris were putting
money aside so our folks could
retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris
was engaged, you know that? Two-Face
took...everything. Now I can pay him
back.

BRUCE
What I do isn't about revenge.

Dick glances at a framed headline. The Wayne murders.

DICK
Right, slick. Whatever you say.

Bruce grabs him. Hard.

BRUCE
This isn't a game.

Dick pushes him off. Harder.

DICK
Back off, man.

BRUCE
You don't understand. It's an
addiction. You fight night after
night, trying to fill the emptiness.
But the pain's back in the morning.
And somewhere along the way it stops
being a choice.
(a beat)
I want better for you.

DICK
Save the sermons about how great you
want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If
it weren't for Batman my parents
wouldn't be dead. You don't get it,
do you? This is all your fault.

Dick storms out. Bruce stares after him with tired eyes.

EXT. RITZ GOTHAM HOTEL - NIGHT

At the marble entrance, the red carpet is rolled out for
a pull-out-the-stops party. Over the door, a banner
proclaims "Nygmatech -- Imagine the Future."

At the curb folks dressed in over-the-top runway
fashions, pour from luxury cars, hand off keys to a
battalion of scurrying valets.

Next car up -- Bruce Wayne's Rolls, driven by Alfred. A
valet helps Chase out. She looks stunning.

Bruce leans over Alfred before stepping out of the car.

BRUCE
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of
Gotham zombied-out. A technology
that self destructs. He's protecting
more than industrial secrets,
Alfred.

ALFRED
I shall be near at hand. Should you
need me. And sir, I know it's
difficult but try and have a good
time.

INT. RITZ GOTHAM ROOF - NIGHT

Over the top golden glitz. A kind of Versailles meets
punk meets couture. And in the middle, Edward, dressed as
Louis XIV.

The room is packed with people sipping exotic cocktails,
munching hors d'oeuvres. Conversation BUZZ is high.

Into this zoo walk Bruce and Chase.

As brightly-lighted stations throughout the room, showy
displays announce "THE NEW BOX". Pretty, barely-clad
showgirls invite partygoers step into various green
columns of light.

Bruce scans the room as he and Chase pause by the first
display, where a Socialite steps into a column of energy.
She GASPS with delight as she finds herself suddenly
dazzling in diamonds from head to toe.

They pass the next column where a CHUBBY PROFESSOR, sword
in hand, fights off a knight on horseback.

They pass the next display where a BALD GUY steps into a
beam. Suddenly, he is in a classic stoner's pad circa
. And, best of all, he has long flowing hair.

Chase looks amused, Bruce suspicious.

CHASE
If I didn't know better, I'd say you
were sulking.

BRUCE
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your
fees are a little rich for me.

CHASE
Touchy, touchy.

BRUCE
(not biting)
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit
of Batman?

CHASE
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.

BRUCE
(flaring)
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're
being ridiculous. I can't be jealous
of Batman.
(to himself)
Can I?

ACROSS THE ROOM

Edward stands flanked by Gotham's Society Matrons as
PRESS, including Vondelle Millions, SNAP photos and hurl
questions.

NEWSCASTER
You're outselling Wayne Enterprises.
Any comments?

EDWARD
Actually, I'm outselling Wayne Tech
two to one...

JOURNALIST
The Times has named you Gotham's
bachelor of the year. What do you
have to say about that?

EDWARD
You might want to ask Bruce Wayne.
(calling)
Bruce, old man!

Edward crosses the room to greet Chase and Bruce. All
stand now, surrounded by press and partygoers.

EDWARD
So glad you could come.

BRUCE
What? Oh, Edward. Hi.
Congratulations. Great party-

EDWARD
The press were just wondering what
it feels like to be outsold,
outclassed, and generally outdone in
every way...
(noticing Chase)
And what light through yonder window
breaks? `Tis the east. And you
are...

CHASE
(charmed)
Chase?

EDWARD
Of course you are. And what a grand
pursuit you must be.
(to Bruce)
What do you think of my new
invention?

BRUCE
What? Oh, it's very impressive.

EDWARD
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely
disappointing. When all this could
have been ours together.

Edward stills a passing waiter and his tray of champagne.
Crystal flutes for all. He toasts Chase.

EDWARD
No grape could be more intoxicating
than you, my dear. But we make due.
To your charms.
(clinking hers)
Skol.

BRUCE
(raising his)
Nostrovia.

EDWARD
(pausing)
La'chiem.

BRUCE
(casual)
Slanta.

EDWARD
Rinka.

BRUCE
Banzai.

CHASE
I'm drinking.

And she does.

EDWARD
I notice you've sub-divided your B
coupons. Feeling a little light on
principle?

BRUCE
Actually, I like to divest just
before a major re-capitalization.

EDWARD

I wouldn't race to the bank. Old
regimes crumble every day. Life is
a cycle. Remember Yeats; turn, turn
the widening gyre. The Falconer
cannot hear the Falcon...

BRUCE
(finishing the poem)
And the beast slouches towards
Bethelem.

CHASE
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop
this testosterone flood on my
account-

EDWARD
Quite right. Shall we dance?

And with that, Edward draws Chase onto to dance floor.

As Chase and Edward dance in the b.g. Bruce walks over to
one of the displays. Examines a control station for the
green beam. Tries to pry open a circuit panel.

SHOWGIRL (OVER)
Naughty, naughty.

She slaps his hand playfully. Bruce smiles an apology.
Looks around. No other choice. He steps into a beam.

EDWARD twirls Chase, watches Bruce enter the beam. He
smiles.

BRUCE - POV. Colorful planets soar all around him. Suddenly
the beam flashes. There, racing towards him, a giant Bat.

BACK TO SCENE

All beams wink out as GUN FIRE bursts across the room.

TWO-FACE and his Thugs stand at every entrance.

BRUCE backs away, slips towards a service door.

TWO-FACE
Alright, folks, this is an old-
fashioned, low-tech stick-up. We're
interested in the basics: jewelry,
cash, watches, high-end cellular
phones. Hand 'em over nice and easy
and no one gets hurt.

Two-Face's Thugs charge the room. The crowd SCREAMS.

EXT. RITZ GOTHAM ALLEY - NIGHT

Bruce hand-slides down fire-escapes, hits the alley
running.

EXT. ALLEY

Bruce ducks into the Rolls.

BRUCE
Emergency, Alfred.

INT. ROLLS

A secret panel in the back opens. A Batsuit.

INT. PARTY

The Thugs circulate quickly, yanking jewels from ears and
necks, grabbing wallets and purses, filling sacks.

Ed pushes his way against the crowd, through Two-Face's
ring of personal guards and right up to Two-Face's face.

EDWARD
You're ruining my big party. Are you
insane? Actually, considering your
dual persona, let's just forget the
question.

TWO-FACE
We're sick of waiting for you to
deliver The Bat, Riddle boy. You
promised us Batman.

EDWARD
Patience, oh bifurcated one.

TWO-FACE
Screw patience. We want him dead.
(looking around)
An nothing brings out The Bat like
a little mayhem and murder.

EDWARD
Oh well, in that case. As long as
you were going to rob me, you could
have at least let me in on the
caper. We could have _organized_ this,
_planned it_, pre-sold the movie
rights.

(OVER) the CRASH of breaking glass.

BATMAN

flies in through a window, kicking a row of Thugs down
before he lets go his rope and lands on the floor.

EDWARD
Harv, babe, I gotta be honest. Your
entrance was good. His was better.
What's the difference? Showmanship.

Two-Face shoves Edward away, looking for a clean shot. He
FIRES a couple of times, but only destroys an ice
sculpture and some liquor bottles. More SCREAMS.

One huge Thug charges Batman. Batman heaves him overhead,
throws him, CRASHING, into a display of stacked Boxes.

VONDELLE (OVER)
Batman, Batman, Batman help!

A Thug has a gun to his throat. Batman kicks the weapon
out of his hand.

VONDELLE
Batman. You're my _God_!!!

Another Thug has Chase to a wall, hand around her pearls.

BATMAN (OVER)
Excuse me.

He head-butts the Thug. The guy goes down.

Chase leans up and kisses him, hard and hot on the mouth.
The chemistry here is undeniable.

CHASE
Call me.

Batman spins, goes for another group of Thugs.

(OVER) POLICE SIRENS.

TWO-FACE
Okay boys. Phase two.

And with that, he and his Thugs race for the elevator.
The doors close.

(OVER) CHEERS erupt for Batman as he races onto the
balcony -- and jumps!

BATMAN'S - POV - AERIAL

Harvey and Thugs disappear past Under Construction signs,
down the stairs of an as yet completed subway station.

EXT. RITZ GOTHAM - NIGHT

PARTY GUESTS - POV. Gripping the edges of his cape, Batman
glides 60 floors down the skyscraper towards the street.

Batman plummets into the construction sight.

INT. DESERTED SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Gothic. Deserted. Under construction. Batman hits the
platform.

BATMAN - POV. Shadows race down the dark tunnel ahead.

He pursues.

TUNNEL

Harvey and Thugs, racing away.

THUG
Bat's right behind us.

TWO-FACE
Excellent.

INT. ABANDONED STATION - VENTILATION SHAFT

A wide spiral staircase of scaffolding hugs the walls of
a tremendous ventilation shaft.

The Thugs race down the steps, knocking out bits of
scaffolding as they go, sending entire chunks of already
traversed staircase plummeting past them.

PAN UP

Batman arrives on a wide platform of scaffolding at the
top of the staircase. His cape whips up around him as if
from some low infernal wind.

BATMAN - POV. Down the fragmenting staircase, at the bottom
of the shaft, a tremendous fan spins, chewing chunks of
falling scaffolding and plaster, spitting plumes of dust.

TWO-FACE

stands at the bottom of the well. He grabs a rack of
scaffolding and wrenches the old aluminum supports away.

THE PLATFORM

where Batman is standing gives way, planks falling,
sending Batman tumbling towards the deadly blades below.

BATMAN - POV. The giant whirling blades, coming up fast.

BATMAN falls, stairways and laughing Thugs whipping past.
His hand shoots out and grabs

A THUG

by the jacket, wrenching the fabric over the goon's head,
jerking him hard into the railing like a human anchor.

Batman climbs the struggling Thug like a ladder, leaps
onto the staircase, CRACKS the Thug's head on the rail,
then races down the stairs.

BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

The remaining Thugs disappear through a dark doorway.
Batman runs past the BEATING fan blades into...

INT. ABANDONED TUNNEL

Dark. Steep and sloping. The Thugs are running dead
ahead. Without stopping they begin grabbing pieces of
debris, flip them under their feet, begin riding down the
descending tunnel like snow-boarders.

Batman races after them.

THE SNOWBOARDERS

really are good. They ride the rails. The low gas pipes.
Even bank the curving sides of the tunnel.

A THUG - CLOSE. Looks back to see Batman closing. Mistake.

WHIP PAN

as he is clotheslined by a low hanging danger sign. He
flies off the snowboard backwards. Out cold.

Batman races past him.

The end of the tunnel slopes so drastically the dark maw
at the end seems more a pit than a door.

The boarders circle and one by one, drop through like
bits of filth down a drain.

Batman drops into the darkness landing on a small ledge.
Beyond a precipitous drop he turns to face...

INT. ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION

Years ago this cavernous space glistened with immense
Gothic statuary, elaborate tile mosaics, tremendous
decorative arches and spectacular cathedral ceilings.

No more.

Now the giant space, from floor to ceiling is a frozen
maelstrom of twisting cast iron trusses, broken steam
pipes, fragmented scaffolding and hanging cables.

Down these man-made slopes and obstacles ride the
snowboarding Thugs. Cruising pipes. Jumping curved faces
of statues. Jacking from scaffold to truss.

Batman whips a pair of nun-chucks from his belt over a
hanging metal rail, using the chain as a pulley, shoots
down a curving rail into the mad dance of twisting steel.

A THUG

FIRES at him from his whizzing board as it careens along
an adjacent piece of scaffolding.

BATMAN angles towards him, picking up speed.

THE THUG banks off some statuary. Takes a few more SHOTS.

BATMAN shoots around the curve, jumps from one rail to
the next, catches the villain in the face with his boot,
and sends him flying.

ANOTHER THUG shoots past over head.

BATMAN flips onto another pipe, is closing fast, chasing
the Thug towards a loop that banks towards the blackness
of an abandoned tunnel.

He is closing on the Thug. Closer. Closer.

Suddenly the Thug, hops to a truss, the rail Batman is on
whipping him around a curve that banks into the mouth of
the tunnel. (OVER) GUNSHOTS.

TWO-FACE

stands in the shadows, FIRING his machine pistol, blowing
a hole in the curving rail directly in front of Batman.

The RAIL breaks.

Batman flies off directly into the dark tunnel.

BATMAN - POV. A rushing darkness. He SMASHES into a wall.

INT. MOUTH OF TUNNEL

Two-Face stands staring into the dark with his Thugs. He
grabs an aging valve wheel set into the crumbling wall.

TWO-FACE
Nothing worse than a bad case of
gas.

He begins to turn the CREAKING wheel.

INT. INNER TUNNEL

A long forgotten pipe by Batman begins to HISS a thick
purple gas.

INT. MOUTH OF TUNNEL

Two-Face swings a grenade launcher before him. Takes a
step back. Aims into the tunnel.

TWO-FACE
Lights. Camera. Action.

As his Thugs scramble for cover, Two-Face FIRES. The
grenade flies into the tunnel, SLAMMING into the gas
main. AN EXPLOSION.

Suddenly a tremendous secondary EXPLOSION. Debris falls
everywhere as the gas ignites, the mouth of the tunnel
suddenly brightening into a flaming white fireball.

INT. TUNNEL

The huge fireball rushes towards Batman. Batman wraps
himself in his cape.

HAND - CLOSE. As he reaches to his utility belt. Presses a
stud there.

His cape begins to run and flow like water morphing into
a protective sphere just as...

A tremendous fireball ROARS races down the tunnel
engulfing Batman in a world of flame.

INT. MOUTH OF TUNNEL

Two-Face stands staring into the inferno.

Billowing smoke, residual flame and falling debris
everywhere. No Batman. A moment of dead quiet.

TWO-FACE
Finally.

Then Two-Face's smirk vanishes.

THUG
It can't be.

REVERSE ANGLE

A shape rises, phoenix-like, out of the flames. The
figure moves forward.

BATMAN - CLOSE. As his cape parts over his face.

WIDER

He lifts his arms, the cape splitting down the center,
reverting to it's original form, arms going wide to
familiar wings.

The Bat heads towards Two-Face and his men.

TWO-FACE - CLOSE. Consumed with rage.

He grabs a section of the wall's support scaffolding
and begins to wrench it free with crazed fury.

TWO-FACE
Why won't you just die?!

In a final rage of maniacal fury, Harvey wrenches the
scaffolding free. It's ancient supports gone...

THE CEILING

begins to crack and fall, debris pouring in at an ever
more furious pace.

BATMAN is suddenly doused in a rain of rock and sand.

THE TUNNEL

between Harvey and Batman is obstructed by tons of
falling metal and plaster and sand. TWO-FACE stands as
the ceiling falls all around him.

BATMAN is driven down by a storm of wreckage.

TWO-FACE can barely contain his joy. Plaster and rubble
fall ever more furiously.

BATMAN stumbles as the ground beneath him suddenly gives,
sucking him into a quickly filling pit of sand and tile.

He reaches for his utility belt but its too late.

BATMAN is nearly buried, sand coming up over his mouth,
his eyes, until finally he is gone.

TWO-FACE stands watching, eyes full of childish delight.

The floor in front of him begins to give way, running
with deep cracks.

TWO-FACE
Boys, let's go have us a party.
(turning)
Anybody else feel like donuts?

Harvey and his men head away, up out of the tunnels.

THE SAND PIT - CLOSE. Still. No motion.

A gloved hand breaks the surface, clutching a Batarang. A
weak flip of the wrist.

The Batarang hist the sand.

The hand goes limp. A beat. Another. Suddenly...

A GREEN GLOVED HAND - CLOSE. Grabs Batman's hand.

WIDER

Dick hangs on a wire above Batman in an aerialist's
maneuver. He secures his grip and pulls.

DICK - CLOSE. Straining.

Suddenly, Batman's face breaks the sand.

Dick uses the leverage of his body on the rope to pull
harder. Batman begins to rise. Free.

The two face each other. Hands still clasped.

INT. BATCAVE - LATER

Bruce sits in his robe being bandaged by Alfred. Dick is
pacing.

BRUCE
What the hell did you think you were
doing?

DICK
You have a real gratitude problem.
You know that, Bruce? I need a name.
Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good
side kick name?

BRUCE
How about Richard Grayson, college
student?

DICK
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat.
When we catch him, you gotta let me
kill him!

BRUCE
We don't kill. Killing is what damns
you. It-. What am I talking about?
This conversation is over. You're
going away to school.

DICK
I saved your life. You owe me. So
either you let me be your partner or
I'm going after Harvey on my own.

And with that Dick turns and storms out of the Batcave.

BRUCE
It's starting all over again,
Alfred. Another boy lost to rage.
And it's my fault. If Harvey hadn't
come gunning for me at the
circus...His family...

Bruce glances at Gotham Times, of Headline- "Bat More
Harm Than Good?"

BRUCE
Maybe they're right.

ALFRED
Which `they' might that be, sir?

BRUCE
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are
avenged. The Wayne Foundation
contributes a small fortune to
police and crime prevention
programs.

Bruce touches a cowl resting on the control panel.

BRUCE
Why do I keep doing this?

ALFRED
Why, indeed?

BRUCE
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For
me. Could I leave the shadows? Have
a life. Friends. Family...

ALFRED
Dr. Meridian...

Bruce touches his lips, the spot Chase kissed Batman.

BRUCE
(pained)
She's the first woman in a long time
that's... No. She's the first woman
ever. And she loves Batman. Not
Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman
I'll lose her.

ALFRED
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask
the lady?

BRUCE
How? As Batman, knowing she wants
me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?

Bruce reaches to the phone. Hits an autodial key.
(OVER) TONES as the phone begins to dial.

PHONE (CHASE)
Hello?..Hello?..Who is this?

He disconnects the phone.

BRUCE
Who am I Alfred? I don't think I
know anymore.

INT. CHASE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dark. Moonlight through curtains. Night SOUNDS.

Chase lays asleep in bed. A shadow crosses her face. She
stirs.

REVERSE ANGLE

At the french doors to her bedroom stands a familiar
silhouette. Batman.

Chase rises, moves across the room, the pale light
catching her white nightgown. She pulls the doors wide.

Chase faces him, bodies close. She reaches up, touches
his mask. Kisses him. His cape WHIPS around her.

THE KISS - CLOSE. Passionate. Sustained. Chase pulls away.

CHASE
I'm sorry.
(sorry)
I can't believe it. I've imagined
this moment since I first saw you.
(touching his glove)
Your hands.
(touching his mask)
Your face.
(touching his chest)
Your body.

She turns, walks across the room.

CHASE
And now I have you and....
(shaking her head)
Guess a girl has to grow up
sometime.

She comes back to him, touches his cheek.

CHASE
I've met someone. He's not...you.
But... I hope you can understand.

He sees now that over her desk, her Batman's memorabilia
has been replaced by photos and files on Bruce Wayne.

BATMAN - CLOSE. Smiles.

Then he's over the balcony and gone, a shadow on the wing
in the dead of night.

INT. CLAW ISLAND CONTROL CENTER - DAY

On his throne, in his sphere, electronically getting more
brilliant every second, Edward fills all his screens with
Chase's image from the party.

HIS BRAIN - CLOSE. Rivulets of neural energy ripple and
dance as his brain grows under his magenta hair.

Suddenly Two-Face gets him by the throat.

TWO-FACE
You know, Ed, we woke up this
morning, we just knew we were gonna
kill something. The Bat got away.
Looks like it's gonna be you.

Two-Face draws his gun with his free hand. Trains it on
Riddler's head. By the look in his eyes, he's serious.

TWO-FACE
Why do we need you? You only come
between us. We can be the smartest
person in Gotham City. We want the
empire for ourselves. Time's up,
laughing boy.

RIDDLER
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead.
Take the empire. All yours.
(grabbing his own head)
Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me
for you.

Riddler grabs his hair, starts SLAMMING his own head into
the desk-top.

RIDDLER
Too...bad...about...Batman.

Harvey grabs his head. Stops him.

TWO-FACE
What about Batman?

Riddler smooths his hair.

RIDDLER
What if you could know a man's mind?
Would you not then own that man?

Riddler hits a switch. Suddenly his screens fill with the
image of Bruce stepping into the simulation at the party.

RIDDLER
A few dozen extra IQ points and my
little invention learned a new
trick. It does more than drain your
brain. It makes a map of your mind.

The screens change, now showing a turning schematic of a
brain, alive with neural lightning.

RIDDLER
Would you like to see what my old
friend Bruce has in his head.

Riddler hits a switch. Another image pulls free from the
schematic brain. A trapped bat. Fierce. Monstrous. The
very picture of imagined evil, made live. Bruce's
nightmare.

RIDDLER
Riddle me this, what kind of man has
bats on the brain?

Two-Face stares at him.

RIDDLER
Go ahead. You can say it.

TWO-FACE
You're a genius.

The tow begin to LAUGH.

CLOSE ON BAT

It's a fake one on top of a pole.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL

Group of YOUNG KIDS in Halloween costumes running through
GOTHAM CEMETERY - DUSK

Two gravestones alone on a hill under a tree.

The kids pass Bruce who is visiting his family's graves.

KIDS
Happy Halloween.

BRUCE
Happy Halloween.

Bruce lays two roses on Thomas and Martha Wayne's graves.

BATMAN
...Tonight it ends.

DICK (OVER)
What the hell do you mean, it ends?

WIDER

INT. BATCAVE

Bruce and Dick are in mid-conversation.

BRUCE
From this day on, Batman is no more.

Bruce hits a switch. The machines in the cave go dark.

DICK
You can't-.

BRUCE
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you
alive. Trust me. I know.

DICK
But what about all the good we can
do? There are monsters out there.
Gotham needs us.

BRUCE
And when you finally get Two-Face?

Dick looks away.

BRUCE
Exactly. And once you'd killed him
you'd be lost. Like me.
(off the cave)
All this has to be a choice.
Otherwise...it's a curse.

DICK
Bruce, you can't.

BRUCE
Chase is coming for dinner. Why
don't you join us.

And with that, Bruce turns, heads up into the house. Dick
stands all alone in the still, dark cave.

(OVER) A doorbell RINGS.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR

Alfred opens the doors to the Trick or Treaters we saw
earlier. Hands out bags of candy.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ACCESS ROAD

A mysterious van sits parked on the gravel byway.

INT. VAN

Two-Face, Riddler, and men sit watching the manor.

RIDDLER - POV. A taxi pulls up. Chase emerges as the Trick
or Treaters leave.

RIDDLER
And today not even my birthday.

Two-Face couldn't care less about Chase. He tosses his
coin. HOLD ON the spinning faces as (OVER) we hear...

TWO-FACE
Bruce, Batman. Bruce, Batman.

INT. COSTUME VAULT, BATCAVE - NIGHT

Opens with a HISS. Dick passes the Batman costumes until
he comes to a standing figure different from the rest.

His Robin costume. He packs to leave forever.

EXT. WAYNE ESTATE

Dick rides his motorcycle through the protective hologram
of the trees, heading away into the dark night.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - DINING ALCOVE - NIGHT

Intensely romantic. Filled with live roses, Alfred leaves
having served an intimate candlelight dinner to Bruce and
Chase.

BRUCE
There's something I want to talk
with you about. It's...Well, we..
I...

CHASE
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going
to give me your pin or something?

Bruce LAUGHS. He's obviously having trouble.

CHASE
Let me go first, okay? I think I've
found something. About your dreams.
I pulled the files on your parents'
murders. There was a missing diary,
Bruce. Alfred told the police your
father always kept it on his desk.
But the day after the murders, it
was gone. Maybe that's the book
you're-

But Bruce isn't listening. He's pressing his eyes. Hard.

BRUCE - POV. A series of images. The coffins. The book. The
run through the stormy night. The fall. The bat.

CHASE
What is it? What's wrong?

BRUCE
Flashes. Images. Of that night.

CHASE
Your memories are repressed. They're
trying to break through. Relax. Try
to remember-.

BRUCE
I don't want to remember!

CHASE
Stop fighting.

A long beat. Then Bruce Wayne surrenders, leans back.
Closes his eyes. Remembers.

BRUCE
My parents are laid out in the
library. Their skin smells like
talcum powder. I'm so small. My
father's diary is on his desk like
always. I'm opening the book.
Reading. I'm running out into the
storm. The book is in my hands. I
can't hear my screams over the rain.
I'm falling...

CHASE
What does it say? What hurts so
much, Bruce? What does the book say?

BRUCE
I don't-.

CHASE
You do know. Try.

Bruce opens his eyes. Clear. He remembers.

BRUCE
The last entry read, Bruce insists
on seeing a movie tonight.
(a beat)
Bruce insists. I made them go out. I
made them take me to the movie. To
that theater...
(finally)
It was my fault. I killed them.

CHASE
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You
weren't responsible.

BRUCE
(to himself)
...Not the bat?

CHASE
What?

BRUCE
I always thought it was the bat that
scared me that night that changed
my life. But it wasn't. The real
fear was hiding underneath: what I
read in the journal, that my parents'
deaths were my fault. That's what I
couldn't remember. That's the crime
I've been paying for all these
years.

CHASE
What are you talking about?

BRUCE
Chase. There's something I need to
tell you--

(OVER) The doorbell RINGS.

FRONT DOOR

Alfred peers out to a sea of Halloween Masks.

LITTLE VOICE
Trick or Treat?

Alfred grabs his candy bags as he opens the door to...

The Riddler, Two-Face and the Thugs.

RIDDLER
Trick.

He CRACKS Alfred on the head with his cane. Down he goes.

TWO-FACE
(to his thugs)
Get the girl.

INT. DINING ALCOVE

(OVER) A COMMOTION.

BRUCE
What the hell?

Thugs appear at both doorways.

Bruce moves fast as he grabs a silver serving tray, flips
it into one of the screaming Thugs' faces, swings the
platter into the other's head. Two down.

Bruce grabs Chase's hand and they're out the door, racing
fast, several more henchmen in close pursuit.

MEANWHILE

The Riddler uses the scanner in the head of his cane to
locate and open the secret door to the Batcave.

INT. HALLWAY

Bruce and Chase race towards the stairway. Bruce pulls
standing display suits of armor to the floor as he goes,
blocking the Thugs' way.

INT. BAT CAVE

Riddler has found heaven. From his pouch he produces tiny
green bombs shaped like bats. He winds one up, its head
SCREECHING with each twist of the neck, lets it fly.

RIDDLER
What's that I hear?

Like a tiny bat, the first bomb flies into the video
wall. A tremendous EXPLOSION.

RIDDLER
Why it must be the fat lady getting
ready to sing.

The next bat-bomb flaps into the costume vault. BLOWS
it completely. The crime lab EXPLODES next.

The Riddler winds a bunch of bat-bombs now, lets them
fly. The tiny green bats sail high forming a giant
question mark in mid-air before plummeting suddenly in
formation down into the cockpit of the Batmobile.

RIDDLER
(Jack's favorite line)
Gonna have a hot time in the old
town tonight.
(a beat)
Who used to say that? Somebody
always used to say that.

The car EXPLODES.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - GRAND STAIRCASE

Bruce and Chase flee up the giant staircase, the Thugs a
step behind. One two-toned bad-guy leaps forward, gets a
fistful of Chase's dress. She goes down. Looks like she's
done for. At the last moment, Chase gives a mighty kick
and the Thug topples backwards, down the stairs.

Bruce is holding off a couple more, closing near the top
step. He spins, a powerful roundhouse clocking one in the
head, sending him backwards down the stairs.

BRUCE
Go!

Chase moves behind him, up to the landing, turns to see
Bruce fell another with a spinning back kick, a third
with a flying back-fist.

Bruce and Chase race to the top of the stairs.

TWO-FACE stands on the floor below. Just the moment he's
been waiting for.

TWO-FACE
See ya.

He SHOOTS. The bullet grazes Bruce's head. He falls down
the grand staircase.

CHASE SCREAMS as Thugs grab her.

BRUCE hits the floor. Hard. No movement. None at all.

TWO-FACE
Bruce, you sure know how to throw a
party.

Two-Face stands over the prostrate form. Draws his gun. SLAMS
in a new clip of ammo.

RIDDLER (OVER)
Sheath your weapon my impetuous
cohort.

Riddler has appeared from the Batcave.

TWO-FACE
We want to dust him. We truly want
to dust him bad.

RIDDLER
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!

Riddler walks over to the unconscious Wayne. Kneels.
Looks at him, tender, like a lover. Caresses his face.

RIDDLER
My poor sweet hero.

He stands, kicks him hard in the rib cage. Bones CRACK.

RIDDLER
We'll kill him alright. But first...
(calling)
Boys.

With that, the Thugs drag out a freshly bound Chase.

CHASE
Bruce!

Riddler drops an envelope (RIDDLE #4) on Bruce.

RIDDLER
...We're going to make him suffer.

INT. BATCAVE

Sputtering. Burning.

INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce is in bed, head bandaged. Alfred is walking a
doctor to the door.

DOCTOR
The injuries are relatively minor.
The shot did cause a concussion.
Watch for headaches. Memory lapses.
Odd behavior. I'll check back in a
few days.

Alfred ushers him out, returns to Bruce's bedside.

ALFRED
How are you feeling, young man?

BRUCE
Not that young. It's been a long
time since you've called me that.

ALFRED
Old habits die hard. Are you
alright?

BRUCE
As well as can be expected, I guess.
Give me the bad news.

ALFRED
Dick has run away. They have taken
Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they
found the cave, sir. It's been
destroyed.

Bruce looks up at Alfred, eyes narrow, puzzled.

BRUCE
The case? What cave?

EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS ROOFTOP

The Batsignal lights the sky. Gordon paces.

GORDON
Where is he?

A concerned DEPUTY emerges onto the roof.

DEPUTY
The Mayor's called again.
(off the signal)
He's not going to show. Maybe he's
hurt sir. Maybe he's--.

GORDON
No!
(not so sure)
...No.

INT. BATCAVE

Or what's left of it. Melted ruin and rubble. Bruce
stands with a worried Alfred, surveying the landscape.

BRUCE
(disbelieving)
I'm Batman? I remember my life as
Bruce Wayne.
(looking around)
But all this. It's like the life of
a stranger.

ALFRED
Perhaps the fall...

BRUCE
There's one other thing. I feel..

ALFRED
What?

BRUCE
...Afraid.

ALFRED
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a
kind man. A strong man. But in truth
you are not the most sane man.

BRUCE
...A bat.

ALFRED
What?

BRUCE
I remember a bat. A monster. A
demon. Chasing me.
(child's terror)
Oh my God, Alfred.

ALFRED
No demons, son.
(touching his head)
Your monsters are here. Until you
fact that, I fear you will spend
your life fleeing them.

INT. RIDDLER'S CONTROL ROOM

Riddler sits on his throne, absorbing pulses of neural
energy, his head growing.

RIDDLER
It's happy time Gotham. Have you
hugged your little boxes today?
(singing)
I'm in heaven. I'm in heaven with a
girl like you.

WIDER

Chase has been chained to the floor of his throne.

CHASE
Batman will come for me.

RIDDLER
(singing)
Someday my bat will come. Some day
my bat will come.
(suddenly lethal)
I'm counting on it.

He puts his face close to Chase's.

CHASE
You're frying your brain.

RIDDLER
Nap time gorgeous.

The Riddler draws a hypo filled with green liquid. He
plunges it into her neck as she passes out.

INT. BATCAVE

Bruce stands before a dark, rocky mouth. Through this
passage, the cave as it once was, sweating granite, a
shifting world of shadow.

Bruce steps inside.

INT. INNER BATCAVE

FAVOR BRUCE as he walks deeper into the darkness. The
walls around him undulate, as if covered in water.

WALLS - CLOSER. The movement isn't water at all. It's the
restless shrugging of bats. Thousands of bats.

Bruce presses on. Sweat beads on his face.

Ahead, a diffusion of moonlight illuminates a curving
rock chamber, bats here too bringing the walls to life.

Bruce moves into the moonlight. Looks up.

BRUCE - POV. A narrow chute. The fall he took as a child.

He kneels, there on the floor, worn by years of weather,
a single book. A diary.

Bruce kneels, touches the leather cover, fingers
lingering for a moment on his father's embossment, before
he turns yellowed pages to the last entry. Painfully, by
moonlight, he reads.

BRUCE (OVER)
(dreaded confirmation)
Bruce insists on seeing a movie
tonight...

He pauses, gathers himself. He continues.

BRUCE (OVER)
But Martha and I have our hearts set
on Zorro, so Bruce's cartoon will
have to wait until next week.

Bruce stares at the book in disbelief. Then he looks up
at the moonlight, tears streaming down his face.

BRUCE
...Not my fault. It wasn't my fault.

Suddenly, in the darkness ahead, a dark shape moves, head
rising, slits opening to reveal two blood red eyes.

The giant monarch bat spreads its wings, huge, as it
rises, suddenly airborne, rushing toward him.

BRUCE - CLOSE. And terrified. He turns to run. The bat's
flapping wings BEAT like drums, closing fast.

Bruce holds his ground. Resolved. He turns and faces the
monster, SCREECHING towards him, glistening fangs barely
inches from his face.

Something remarkable happens. The bat holds its
position, stares into Bruce's eyes, wings spreading wide.

A beat. Then Bruce raises his arms, a living mirror. The
two stand facing each other, man and bat. In the moon-
light on the wall, their shadows begin to blend, to
merge, becoming one _SHIMMERING WHITE LIGHT!_

INT. BATCAVE

The mouth of the inner cave. A sudden SCREAMING DIN as a
storm of bats explode into the cave, a shooting column of
life and there, from within, steps a man.

REVERSE ANGLE

ALFRED stands at the entrance.

ALFRED
Master, Bruce?

BRUCE
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.

EXT. NIGHT SKY

The Batsignal shines. Suddenly the air above the familiar
circle begins to shimmer and glow, becoming...

A giant green question mark. The Batsignal itself is now
just the small period at the symbol's bottom.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Bruce stands at the ruined control platform. Riddles are
spread before him. Including the most recent.

BRUCE
All the answers are numbers.

ALFRED
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?

BRUCE
What do maniacs always want?

ALFRED
Recognition, of course.

BRUCE
Precisely. So this number is
probably some kind of calling card.

Bruce stares at the numbers. Adds them: 18. Squares them:
. No luck. Starts again, separating them: 13/18/5.

BRUCE
Letters in the alphabet.

ALFRED
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.

BRUCE
How about, MR. E.

ALFRED
Mystery.

BRUCE
And another name for Mystery?

ALFRED
Enigma.

BRUCE
Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.

INT. STONE STAIRCASE

Bruce leads Alfred through a secret stairway.

BRUCE
Good thing Mr. E. didn't know about
the cave under the cave.

INT. SUBTERRANEAN CAVE

Dark, jagged, surrounded by water. Here, the Batwing and
Batboat are stored.

ALFRED
What now sir?

BRUCE
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters.
I'm sure that's where they're
keeping Chase.
(realizing)
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?

ALFRED
All except the prototype with the
sonar modifications you so
disapprove of. But it hasn't yet
been tested.

BRUCE
Tonight's a good night.

CLOSE ON - Batman's fist being shoved into a new gauntlet.

CLOSE ON - Batman's new boot snapping shut.

CLOSE ON - the improved Utility Belt buckling on firmly.

CLOSE ON - the new cowl sliding down over Batman's head.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The Batman - a darker enemy to fear.

BATMAN
What do you suggest, Alfred. By see or by air?

DICK (OVER)
Why not both?

A figure steps out of the shadows. Dick.

The cape is now black, yellow on the inside only. A red
armored vest compliments green tights with knee armor, a
utility belt and flexible black boots.

BATMAN
Dick... Where did you get that suit?

ALFRED
I...um..took the liberty, sir.

DICK
I thought you could use a friend.

Bruce stares at him a beat.

BATMAN
Not a friend.

He extends his hand.

BATMAN
A partner.

The Dynamic Duo clasp hands.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - TENNIS COURT - NIGHT

Fast clouds. Bowing trees.

Suddenly, the entire tennis court slides away.

The Batwing rises into the night sky.

EXT. STORM DRAIN

The Batboat hits the water.

EXT. ROOFTOP OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Commissioner Gordon and his deputy, standing vigil under
the false moon of the Batsignal.

GORDON
(finally)
He's not coming. Shut it down.

The Deputy reaches for the power switch. Suddenly, a ROAR
cuts the night.

ANGLE UP TO

The Batsignal. The ROAR grows louder. Light and shadow
dance, for a second it seems the Batsignal itself is
flying toward us. Suddenly --

The Batwing bursts _through_ the signal.

The dark plane BUZZES Police Headquarters, dipping a wing
to Gordon.

A triumphant Gordon waves Batman onward.

INT. COCKPIT

Working the controls, Batman is back.

EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

Still, night waters.

Suddenly, the Batboat, running silent and dark, cuts
across the harbor.

Dick is at the helm, wearing night-vision goggles.

DICK'S POV -- INFRA-RED. Claw Island looms ahead.

SEARCHLIGHTS

atop the island headquarters pop on, one by one, flooding
the water with light.

INT. RIDDLER'S CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

The Riddler and Two-Face stand clutching controls on
opposite sides of a holographically generated game of
Battleship.

Each is firing tiny blips at the small dot crossing the
floating screen.

RIDDLER
A-14.

TWO-FACE
Miss.

EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

A mortar EXPLODES aft of the Batboat, shooting a WATER
SPOUT high in the sky.

INT. RIDDLER'S CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

TWO-FACE
B-12.

RIDDLER
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I
might add.

EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR

Another EXPLOSION to stern.

Dick is thrown as a third shell hits the Batboat. The
craft EXPLODES.

INT. NYGMATECH - RECREATION ROOM

TWO-FACE
A hit.

RIDDLER
You sunk my battleship.

EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

Dick slips a re-breather into his mouth. Dives
underwater, starts to swim towards Claw Island.

UNDERWATER

A SPEAR shoots past leaving a trail of bubbles. Another.

A HIDDEN BUNKER

issues a stream of armed frogmen.

EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

The BATWING soars over the water.

INT. BATWING COCKPIT

INFRA-RED SCREEN - CLOSE

A Dick blip, besieged underwater by frogmen blips.

EXT. CLAW ISLAND - NIGHT

A laser shoots from the top of the stronghold, neatly
severing one of the Batwing's wings.

EXT. BATWING - GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

The Batwing dives straight into the river.

INT. COCKPIT

BATMAN - POV - THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN. The water comes up
fast, a rushing EXPLOSION.

EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - UNDERWATER

Dark panels shift, sealing wheel hubs, growing sleek fins
as the Batwing morphs now into the Batsub.

UNDERWATER

Two frogmen hold Dick by arms and legs as several more
swim towards him with exposed knives.

THE BATSUB

BLASTS over an underwater reef.

A TORPEDO TUBE - CLOSE. FIRES a dark rocket towards the
frogmen at blinding speed.

A FROGMAN - CLOSE. Spins.

FROGMAN'S POV - THROUGH MASK. The torpedo racing towards
him unfurls to reveal...Batman.

BATMAN'S FIST smashes the glass of the Frogman's mask.

THE THUG rises in a mass of bubbles.

DICK uses the distraction and kicks free. Batman and Dick
take on the frogmen, hand to hand.

EXT. CLAW ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT

Batman and Dick break the surface. Dick discards his re-
breather. Climbs onto the shore.

DICK
Holy rusted metal, Batman.

BATMAN
What?

Dick takes a few steps forward, kneels.

DICK
(off the rusted floor)
The ground. It's metal and its full
of holes. You know. Holey.

BATMAN
This place was a refueling station
for subs during the war...

Just as Batman starts to climb out of the water (OVER) a
horrendous CRUNCHING as Dick begins to rise.

WIDER

The island surface is actually the top of a tremendous
metal sphere balanced atop an enormous cylindrical oil
tank, rising, now, fast out of the water.

BATMAN
Dick.

Batman throws a Batarang but it glances off the side of
the sphere.

WIDER

Batman stands staring up at Dick, who stands alone atop
the metal sphere now near five stories high.

No way up. Batman spots a rusting access panel in the
giant support cylinder. He RIPS it off and climbs inside.

EXT. DOME

Dick stands looking down at the ocean.

TWO-FACE (OVER)
The Bat or the Bird. We couldn't
decide who got to kill who.
(a beat)
Or is it whom?

Dick spins. Two-Face has emerged from a hatch atop the
dome. He stands smiling at Dick, a knife in his hands.

TWO-FACE
We flipped for it. We got you.

Two-Face's leap is savage, catching Dick by the throat.

WIDER

The two slide down the sloping edge of the dome, their
descent stopped by a narrow, rusting metal lip.

Two-Face SMASHES Dick's head into the side of the dome.
Once. Twice. Three times.

TWO-FACE
What's wrong, circus-boy? No mommy
and daddy to save you?

Two-Face raises his blade over the dazed Dick. Brings it
down fast.

Dick rolls clear, the blade wedging into the rusted metal
surface. All the time Dick needs. He back-flips erect,
kicks Two-Face hard in the head.

DICK
For my mother.

A flying front kick to the chin.

DICK
For my father.

A spinning back kick knocking him to his knees.

DICK
For Chris.

Dick hauls off and smashes him in the face.

DICK
For me.

The punch sends Two-Face rolling down the side of the
dome, fingers raking sloping steel, finding no purchase.

At the last second, Two-Face grabs a small metal dimple
on the belly of the dome's curve, hanging on for dear
life, feet kicking wildly over the abyss.

TWO-FACE
The scales are tipped. The blindfold
torn from the lady's eyes. Justice
will be served.

The rusting metal bulge starts to tear and break.

TWO-FACE
You're a man after my own heart,
son.

The metal breaks free.

TWO-FACE
(grinning)
See you in hell.

Two-Face's hands tear through the rust. He falls.

DICK'S HAND grabs him.

WIDER

Dick hoists him to safety.

DICK
No. I'd rather see you in jail.

TWO-FACE
The Bat's taught you well. Noble.

Two-Face spins, a gun suddenly in his hand, pressing now
into the flesh between Dick's eyes.

TWO-FACE
A mistake. But definitely noble.

Two-Face COCKS the trigger.

INT. CYLINDER

Immense. Empty. Just the CRASHING surf and rocks below.
Batman looks up. The ceiling is...

A GIANT STEEL GRATE flush with the sides of the cylinder.
Batman loads a Batarang into his launcher. FIRES.

THE BATARANG flies high, secures purchase on the grate.

BATMAN attaches the cable to the winch on his belt.
Begins rising fast.

THE GRATE BOLTS

EXPLODE, causing the giant grate to fall towards Batman.

BATMAN twirls on the rope so he is rising upside down,
his feet racing towards the plummeting grate. He hits a
switch on his utility belt-

THRUSTERS

on his new Batsuit ROCKET him feet first towards the
descending grate.

IMPACT! The grate flips like a pie pan. Batman lets go of
the wire, cutting his thrusters and tumbling in mid-air
so his hands now extend before him. He grabs one of the
steel girders in the darkness overhead.

Batman hangs, watching the now dislodged grate fall to
the watery depth below. A beat. He hoists himself onto a
steel platform to face...

INT. RIDDLER'S CONTROL ROOM

The Riddler sits across the room in his throne, a huge
antenna shooting up into the night sky behind him through
a round hole in the dome. A large ring of Green Neon
encircles him, feeding him more and more brain power.

RIDDLER
Welcome to my parlor said the
Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?

BATMAN
No more tricks, Edward. Release
Chase and Dick. This is between you
and me.

Two-Face steps from behind The Riddler.

TWO-FACE
And me and me.

BATMAN
(off the antenna)
...Of course. The Box does more
than enhance neural energy. You've
been sucking Gotham's brainwaves.

RIDDLER
And now it's new. Improved. Better
than ever.

SCREENS - CLOSE - Endless schematics of flickering brains.

BATMAN
...The jolt I felt in the beam at
your party.
(getting it)
You've devised a way to map the
human brain. To read men's minds.

RIDDLER
Oh, Bruce, you are clever. How
fitting that numbers lead you to me.
For numbers will crown me king. My
Box will sit on countless TV's
around the globe, mapping brains,
giving me credit card numbers. Bank
codes. Safe combinations. Numbers of
infidelities. Of crimes. Of lies
told. No secret is safe from my
watchful electronic eye. I will
rule the planet. For if knowledge is
power then tremble world, Edward
Nygma has become a God.
(to Harvey)
Was that over the top? I can never
tell...
(to Batman)
By the way, B-man, I got _your_
number.

SCREENS - CLOSE form a towering picture of Batman.

OTHER SCREENS - CLOSE form a towering picture of Bruce.

The images collide, forming a half Bruce, half Batman.

RIDDLER
I've seen your mind. Yours is the
greatest Riddle of all. Can Bruce
Wayne and Batman ever truly coexist?
Stop me if I'm wrong here.

Batman remains stoic, but The Riddler is right on.

RIDDLER
So let's help you decide, once and
for all, who you really are. Behind
Curtain #1...

A curtain rises: Chase in a cylinder, bound unconscious.

RIDDLER
The captivating Dr. Chase Meridian.
Love of Bruce Wayne's life. Behind
curtain #2...

Another curtain reveals: Dick in similar peril.

RIDDLER
Batman's one and only partner.
(a beat)
Below, my personal favorite...

TRAP DOORS

beneath Chase and Dick open wide. ANGLE DOWN to the
jagged rocks and crashing surf below.

RIDDLER
A watery grave!

A BUTTON - CLOSE. Shaped like a glowing green skull.

RIDDLER
A simple touch and five seconds
later these two day players are so
much gull feed on the rocks below.
Not enough time to save them both.
So who will it be? Bruce's love?
Batman's partner? You decide. Is
this fun or what?

BATMAN
Edward, you've become a monster.

RIDDLER
You flatter me. No monster. Just The
Riddler, and here's yours. What is
without taste or sound, all around,
but can't be found? On your mark,
get set...

The Riddler reaches for the button. Batman steps forward.

ANGLE from the water below.

The floor between where Batman stands and the Riddler's
throne platform is translucent. A hologram masking a
tremendous gap. Batman is about to step into an abyss.

Batman stops short. Looks up at Riddler.

BATMAN
Death.
(louder)
Death. Without taste, sound and all
around us.
(getting it)
Because there is no way for me to
save them or myself. This is one
giant death trap.

RIDDLER
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a
rubber suit can't be smart? Well,
it's been grand. Sorry you all have
to die now.

Riddler touches the skull button. (OVER) A SCREECH.

Batman looks up.

HIGH ABOVE the Riddler's antenna a giant monarch bat
glides across the night.

THE BAT - CLOSE.

BATMAN - CLOSE. No fear. A moment of communion.

BATMAN
Wait. I have a riddle for you.

RIDDLER
For _me_? Really? Tell me.

BATMAN
I see without seeing. To me,
darkness is as clear as daylight.
What am I?

RIDDLER
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.

BATMAN
Exactly!

Batman SLAMS his Utility Belt, releasing a high energy
Batarang which he hurls at the Riddler's huge antenna.

THE BATARANG

SMASHES into the Riddler's antenna. A tremendous
EXPLOSION of sparks as the transceiver short circuits.

RIDDLER
No!

The room goes pitch black.

RIDDLER'S FINGER - CLOSE. Hits the skull button.

DICK AND CHASE

drop, plummet through space.

BATMAN - CLOSE. Two metal lids SHUT over Batman's eyes.

BATMAN'S POV - INSIDE THE MASK

Small sonar screens on the back of Batman's eyepieces
reveal the phantom floor and the wild criss-cross of
interconnected steel beams and the crashing ocean below.

BATMAN

throws another Batarang, which lassos a beam overhead,
swings forward, grabbing a falling Chase as he passes,
depositing her on a steel platform.

BATMAN - POV (SONAR SCREENS). Dick drops to certain death.

BATMAN

dives towards the sea below as he whips another Batarang
around a passing girder. He catches Dick just above the
rocks precisely as the Batrope pulls taught, using the
bat-winch to shoot them back up to the platform.

BATMAN - POV (SONAR SCREENS)

As he rests Dick on the platform beside Chase. Suddenly
his world flares a blinding white.

TWO-FACE

stands on the platform before him, a halogen light
strapped around his head, blinding Batman's sensors.

Two-Face brandishes his gun.

TWO-FACE
All those heroics for nothing. No
more riddles, no more curtains one
and two. Just plain old curtains.

He COCKS the trigger.

BATMAN
Haven't you forgotten something,
Harvey? You're always of two minds
about everything....

The handsome side of Harvey's face turns toward them.

TWO-FACE
Oh. Emotion is so often the enemy of
justice. Thank you, Bruce.

He takes out his famous coin and flips it. Batman starts
to reach for his Utility Belt, to out-smart Two-Face. But
as the coin flies high up in the air, it comes down just
a hair too far away.

TWO-FACE
No!

As Two-Face reaches out to catch it, he loses his balance
and falls to the rocks and angry sea below.

BATMAN
Help Chase. I'll be back.

CHASE
(groggy)
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?

DICK
Of course not.

Batman starts scaling girders, pulls himself back into...

INT. RIDDLER'S CONTROL ROOM

The lights are still down but the antenna's functioning
again, the Riddler in his throne, absorbing pulses of
neural energy. Too much. his entire head seems to
distort, fluctuating in size and wavering.

RIDDLER
Why can't I kill you? Now there's a
riddle?
(more juice)
Not smart enough. Find a way.
(more juice)
Too many questions.
(more juice)
Why you and not me?
(more juice)
Why me?
(more juice)
Why??!!

Batman SLAMS the power switch, the throne going dark.

EDWARD - CLOSE. Knees drawn to his chest. Pathetic.
WHIMPERING. Mad.

Batman looks down, his eyes sad, compassionate.

BATMAN
Poor, Edward. I had to save them
both. You see, I am Bruce Wayne and
Batman. Not because I have to be.
Now because I choose to be.

Batman reaches out to Edward. Ed jerks in fear, looks up.

EDWARD'S POV - Coming towards him, not Batman, but a
hideous demonic giant bat.

EDWARD - CLOSE. SCREAMS

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM - NIGHT

Another stormy night.

INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING

Dr. Burton walks the corridor with Chase.

DR. BURTON
Edward Nygma has been screaming for
hours that he knows the true
identity of Batman.

They reach Edward's cell.

THEIR POV -- INT. PADDED CELL

Lit only by the moon. Chase speaks through the small
barred set into the heavy door.

CHASE
Edward...

EDWARD
Who is it?

CHASE
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you
remember me?

EDWARD (O.S.)
How could I forget?

CHASE
Dr. Burton tells me you know who
Batman is.

EDWARD (O.S.)
(giggle, giggle)
Yesssssss. I know!

Chase and Burton look at each other, on edge.

CHASE
Who is The Batman, Edward?

EDWARD (O.S.)
Can't tell if you don't say please.

CHASE
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean
to be impolite. Please.

No response. Just GIGGLES.

CHASE
Edward, please. Who is Batman?

A beat. Suddenly a huge silhouette of a bat appears on
the padded wall. Into it leaps Edward, the sleeves of his
straightjacket madly flapping like the wings of a bat.

EDWARD
I AM BATMAAAAAAANN!!!

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM - NIGHT

Chase comes down the front steps to find Alfred waiting
with the Rolls, holding the rear door open.

CHASE
Alfred?

ALFRED
Mr. Wayne sent me to pick you up.

INT. ROLLS - MOVING

Alfred drives out the front gates of Arkham Asylum.

CHASE
Where's Bruce?

ALFRED
He asked me to convey his deepest
apologies, Dr. Meridian. But he
wanted me to give you this.

Alfred hands her a small wicker figure. The dream doll.

ALFRED
He said to thank you. And to tell
you he no longer needs it.

She notices the Batsignal in the night sky.

CHASE
Does it ever end Alfred?

ALFRED
No, Miss. Not in this lifetime.

Chase looks out the car window. In the distance, the
shape of the bat shimmers against the clouds.

ZOOM INTO

The Batsignal, filling the screen.

PAN DOWN

EXT. TOP OF SKYSCRAPER - NIGHT

Batman stands on the edge of the gargoyled building, a
lone silhouette keeping vigil over the city.

Then another figure steps up into frame, taking his place
behind Batman. Their capes billow in the city wind.

Now there are two guardians of the night: Batman and
Robin. Beware!

FINAL FADE TO BLACK.
